and it is just not our thing. Thus, we shouldn’t even try. It is easy to get into 
this trap as a kid due to yet low self-confidence. Consider stopping for a moment and explicitly
catching all ideas like that. Let’s see why you might discover a lot of new about
yourself this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;talent-is-weird&quot;&gt;Talent is weird&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is indeed the case that a person has very strong innate talent and just
excels in some area. However, in the majority of cases it is not like that. Skills
require time and practice. It is naive to expect immediate results. However, external
observers very often forget about this. Yes, a given kid may not sing too exquisite, but
this does not mean that they can’t sing well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One does not require that much of talent, but rather just interest and curiosity 
about the area. If one desires to practise and get better, this is already enough
to do so. You don’t have to be good at something, in order to be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-your-main-reason&quot;&gt;What is your main reason?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the second point. There may be various reasons to get better
at some skill. For example, it is just fun and one enjoys the process. This is
a perfectly valid reason to just do the thing. The growth is not important.
You don’t have to even show what you are doing to others. If one likes to
sing in the shower, please go ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason might be to make money or to impress others. In this case, one
has to care about external opinion. If someone says that you should stop,
this is just a feedback that what you are doing now is not good enough &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;.
Take into account negative feedback, but remember to decrease its
amplitude. Also don’t focus on the negativity, but try to understand what
exactly causes such effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revisiting-i-never-will-be-able-to&quot;&gt;Revisiting “I never will be able to…”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a bunch of areas about which I can
easily say “I never will be able to do it”. For some of them I even spent
quite some time in my childhood and even took lessons. That is I had
quite enough of data to make my conclusion and decide to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with years somehow by chance I went back to some of these areas.
To my surprise, a) it wasn’t that bad
back then b) I can actually improve these skills further and it goes pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then it has become my personal sport to tackle such areas.
If there is something about which I could say “I will never be able to do this well”,
I am definitely lured to disprove that. This was definitely hard at first,
when I didn’t have any positive examples. E.g. I remember
I tried ice skating as a kid. I sucked at it really terribly. But as far as I remember
I tried only once or twice. Then I concluded that this was not mine and I should have focuses
into something else. After some years, I tried again and it just went fine.
I was able to learn to ice skate reasonably well and it is a lot of fun.
With each new such example of breaking “I will never…”, I get
more self confidence to tackle even harder areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, you are now quite a different person. You know so much
more, you have experienced so much more in your life and the world is different now.
There are new challenges, new opportunities. Perhaps something that blocked you back
then is now gone. Perhaps the technology has improved. Perhaps the learning materials
are now so much better. Thus, it makes sense once in a while to revisit your self
beliefs about what you can do and what you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine some really serious obstacles on one’s way to some skill
(e.g. physical body irregularities). Yes, this may affect the traditional
way of tackling the skill, but nothing prevents one from trying something else.
There are people, who play guitar with their legs (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/CK2TkN0m1SM?t=93&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;irrationality-of-i-will-never-be-able-to&quot;&gt;Irrationality of “I will never be able to…”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense, “I will never be able to…” is almost always false.
Obviously, there are examples where such statement is hard to disprove.
E.g. breathing under water. But if it is about some human developed area
(like art, sport) and the bar is not too challenging (e.g. not world class or Olympic level),
the question is only about how much time one needs to achieve this level. 
It is also about how much time one is ready to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that some skills go better due to some innate ability and just
general life situation. Perhaps one already has skills which work well in that field.
E.g. from math into programming. However, the absence of some skill should never be
a blocker. It just means that one will have to spend more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I suggest to rephrase “I will never be able to…” into 
“I consider it is not reasonable to invest so much time into area X
to reach level Y”. This moves the question from your ability into
your priorities and decisions. Sounds much better, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sometimes-it-goes-better-once-you-start&quot;&gt;Sometimes it goes better once you start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of ignoring such self doubts is that
one can discover their innate ability once they start working
on their skill. Perhaps at first it goes badly, but after
some time they can discover that they are actually quite good at it.
Thus, one should avoid premature conclusions and dropping stuff
too early. Unfortunately, I have no clue when it is the best time to stop trying.
Perhaps when it is not fun anymore.
But to avoid false positives, it should rather be “when it is constantly not fun anymore
for a specific predefined period of time (e.g. a month)”. Otherwise one could
drop out by accident e.g. on a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-others-do-this&quot;&gt;Why do others do this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do other people seed such self doubts?
Obviously this can be malicious (either explicitly
or implicitly). If a competition is possible, it is
easier for them to just convince you to drop than
to actually compete properly. This may happen implicitly as well
(i.e. person does not realize what they are doing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, they may believe into innate fixed talent 
(i.e. fixed mindset instead of growth mindset) and even consider
their advice very beneficial for you. They may not want you to
waste your time. From their perspective, since you does not perform
well at this, you never will and should search for something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observed quite a few examples of parents saying this to their kids.
Often this is supported by an argument that parents themselves are really bad at
this skill and, thus, the kids are genetically predisposed to be bad as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dangers-of-such-self-doubts&quot;&gt;Dangers of such self doubts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with such self doubts
is that they become deeply ingrained self-fulfilling prophecies. 
One just stops questioning this statement. It just becomes part of 
them and as a result - becomes completely true. Each time one claims
that they are not good at something and refuses even to try,
they push this self doubt even further into themselves. They self
reinforce it. With time they may even fully forget where it actually came
from and just live with it as a fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, next time you catch yourself thinking that you are not good at something
and as a result shouldn’t even try, try to understand where this is coming from
and whether this is still actually the case. Perhaps it is not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy self improvement, while crashing your irrational self doubts!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Often we can get conditioned from outside that we have no talent in some area and it is just not our thing.

Jump in!
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I noticed the new thought experiment by chance and didn’t plan to write it yet,
but I have some time, so why not. Excited to know that it was proposed by 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MoneyModernGirl&quot;&gt;@MoneyModernGirl&lt;/a&gt;. Also funny that 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavingNinja&quot;&gt;@SavingNinja&lt;/a&gt; started to have so many external thought
experiment ideas. This is likely just a recency bias. I remember that last 2 experiments
were proposed by other people. Perhaps, participants just started to propose their ideas.
Ok, feels like I am already in “dump everything verbatim” mood.
Thus, it is the time to read the new experiment! I actually feel much more excited than I was
when I started writing this paragraph. Wow, the magic of writing and just starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-statement&quot;&gt;The statement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recently read a statistic that 85% of the jobs there will be in 2030 have not yet been created. What do you think these jobs are, and which ones will no longer exist? What does this mean for education? What will offices look like in 11 years? Will people continue to commute to a physical office or will remote work and digital nomadism take over? Finally, how do you think this will affect the overall global economic balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment page is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/the-future-of-work&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and it has links to other answers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-answer&quot;&gt;My answer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, at least I understand all the words in the description and don’t need a dictionary.
Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this time there are 2 major ways to answer this question for me.
The first one “I read that” and the second one “My own opinion”.
The issue is that the second one is very tricky to produce aka I don’t have much opinion yet.
But I will just write and I am pretty sure that by the end of this post I will have a pretty strong 
opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What do you think these jobs are, and which ones will no longer exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read in multiple places that these will be mostly creative jobs. I tend to agree.
People are doing great at improving efficiency in areas which are necessary for life.
E.g. fewer and fewer people are involved in agriculture (I read this somewhere and feel
lazy to find a proof, sorry). Thus, I assume that this trend will to some degree continue.
2030 is actually pretty soon, so I don’t think there will be full automation by 2030. 
At least I would be very surprised. I suspect that current technology is not sufficient yet
for that (or I just don’t know enough).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, more and more people will be forced to move away from these “strictly-needed-for-life” fields
into “technically-not-needed-but-makes-fun” fields. Some part of this outflow of people should definitely
go to existing creative professions. E.g. writing, making music, videos, painting. This also gets
easier and easier nowadays. One can make a video and publish it on Youtube or even self publish
a book on Amazon. This does not mean that someone will buy it, but at least it is much easier
than publishing a paper book (and so muuuuuuuuuuuuch cheaper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tendency to automation will create demand for make-automation-happen jobs. Some people need
to maintain the automation. Hm, could this be automated? Not sure, perhaps not at first. Some
people will need to develop automation (thus, research). Some people will need to produce tools
for automation (thus, hardware, software). These areas won’t be that relatively large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also presume that it will be cheaper to buy all the necessities in life. I.e. something like on
the way to Universal Basic Income, but not that dramatic. Since producing stuff needed for life 
gets more efficient and, thus, cheaper, one will need to work less to be able to afford all of that.
One will also have less pressure to work due to that. That’s another argument for creative fields.
People will get more fun from work, because they are not forced to work that much as now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I also read is that customized stuff will be super expensive (this time I remember the source:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/levelsio/&quot;&gt;levelsio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1170997682728361985&quot;&gt;specific tweet&lt;/a&gt;). These cheap ways to satisfy one’s needs will be produced by automation
and will be quite generic. In some sense it is like mass produced clothing now. You do have some choice
(e.g. which color or size), but you don’t get to choose everything about the item (e.g. how it should
be made, precise template). I assume that something like that will happen in the future as well.
Probably, not in 2030, but I think it will already be much cheaper to satisfy basic needs in 2030.
Here I definitely remember that making future predictions is risky, but I am also not betting any
money, so I am fine to do some here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, highly customized stuff will become more expensive and there will be people who produce it.
In some sense this still fulfills the old description - these jobs can be creative. One can buy
a cheap mass produced t-shirt and know that there are thousands (or millions) of them in the world. Or they can pay
much more to a tailor to make a unique one specifically for them. For a tailor this can definitely
be like a creative endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now I see that the two ways above (what I read vs what I think) do intersect a lot.
So please excuse the mess, but we are going further!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for education?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. That’s tricky one. It definitely means that the education will have to change.
Currently the education is meant as a way to produce humans who can create some value in the
world to be able to satisfy their basic life needs. If it becomes much easier to satisfy these needs 
(the extreme case is Universal Basic Income), then the pressure to study should become much smaller.
Obviously, there will be people who will study, but their intention will be very different.
It will be just for their intrinsic fun. If they decide to drop out for some reason, they can definitely
do that. I also think that the studies will have to become more practical. The demand for 
some highly theoretic stuff should go down, but for practical “how to do XYZ” - up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is mostly about higher education, e.g. uni. It is actually hard to imagine what kind of
knowledge will be necessary to be learned in the school. Obviously, in 2030 few will worry about this
and just continue having the old material they used to have, but at some point people will notice
that a lot of it does not make much sense anymore and stop teaching it. Perhaps the mandatory school part
will be compressed in couple years with some really basic stuff like reading, writing, counting,
using Internet, writing blog posts, paying with a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing the paragraph above, I noticed that this absence of pressure to study should create a field
producing these pressure artificially. If you don’t have to do anything, it is very easy to overreact and quit
stuff. For example, “oh, I am having a headache today, let’s drop this university course, perhaps this will help”.
Also I suspect that psychology should become more popular too (not studying it, but using).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What will offices look like in 11 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they will mostly look like they do nowadays.
There are already examples of companies with no office. surveymonkey.com came to mind
and I can’t remember the second example I heard recently. I assume that the trend will continue.
In some sense the number of jobs which require physical presence are decreasing.
Being in one office is good for communication, but there are workarounds for that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also suspect that coworking spaces will continue to become more popular. If everyone is into
something creative and completely on their own, they will get lonely fast. Thus, being able to
communicate/collaborate with others even when you are not from one company will be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I suspect that 11 years is just not that much. Or perhaps am I being to conservative?
I think a good way to sanity check this claim is to think about what changed since 2008 
(i.e. 11 years before today). To be honest, nothing too major gets in my mind.
There are many more smart-phones for sure. The offices seem to be pretty much the same.
Yes, the nomad movement is much more popular (I don’t think I ever heard about it back
then at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will people continue to commute to a physical office or will remote work and digital nomadism take over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See above.
Some will do, because their job requires that, e.g. hardware development or maintenance. 
Majority won’t have too. Some will do this voluntarily when they feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is funny that so many office people find the other extreme of having no office 
so nice and attractive. I am pretty sure that once they try it, they will find
plenty of aspects in which their office job wasn’t that bad. E.g. I read that nomads
have very few deep friendships, because it is trickier to build a friendship without
being able to meet and spend time together. I didn’t say impossible. E.g. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/&quot;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt; claims to have phone calls with his friends
and this seems to work well for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, how do you think this will affect the overall global economic balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hard question. I suspect that everyone will become a bit more frugal when compared to now.
Now one has to work quite a lot, because otherwise they won’t be able to live sustainably.
At the same time, the job offerings are often such that one has to work a lot more than
they would need to just satisfy their needs. As a result, they have plenty of spare money
and this ends up in consumerism. I feel like being able to work creatively with little financial
pressure should change this. I.e. people will refuse to work that much for stuff they don’t need.
To be honest, once I wrote this it is hard to believe. At least that’s my hope in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that this will stop the economic growth though. These creative endeavors can still
produce value and one could invest into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I got a feeling that my hand-wavy descriptions are missing something, so let’s try
consider a concrete example. This is probably not from 2030, somewhat later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Jane. She is 12 now. She has already finished her mandatory part of education.
She is free to choose what to do next. She needs 100$ per month to have basic food, some
reasonable-but-modest shelter, minimal fun. She can study a lot for the next years and become
an automation robot developer and earn like 10k$ per month. This produces a lot of value
(scales well) and not many people want to do this - learning all the tricky stuff is boring and hard.
Or she can take some shorter more practical classes. E.g. music, drawing, writing.
She can produce some content on her own and be payed for (or by donations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to uncover what makes me feel uneasy about my arguments. If everyone is lazy and frugal,
why would someone pay Jane for her music? E.g. nowadays it is extremely hard to get payed by
one’s creative endeavors. In some sense, you must be pretty good to get there. It cannot be the
case that everyone will be equally good. Thus, there will be some competition anyway.
So I am not sure how to resolve this. If Jane gets 100$ per month from her country, then
my model seems to work. If she needs to earn them - than it is tricky. It some sense
Jane is not needed anywhere. This sounds a bit scary. Perhaps she could start her own 
“industry” the same way “let’s-play” videos and streams have started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I suspect that not much will change by 2030. The descriptions above are in my view
more likely for 2050-2100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is funny to experience this conflict, which automation brings. In some sense it tells
you - hey, your work is not needed anymore, but providing for your basic needs is so cheap
that we are happy to do so (perhaps even completely for free). Thus, just enjoy your life.
So will we become a bunch of low educated pleasure seeking constantly depressed weirdos?
It is also funny to think of the impact of this survival pressure on my life. I think I would
have achieved much less if there was no pressure to work and earn money. I also wouldn’t end
up discovering the areas which I enjoy a lot now. I would consider them too difficult and not
worth it. However, I like them a lot now. Perhaps, I would discover something else then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time for people who are adults right now this switch should be okeyish. They already have
developed their sense of “I must stick to this and get through”. Thus, they will be able to figure
out some way to live reasonably happy life even when their job is not needed anymore.
I have no clue how new generations will handle this. Will they be able to self challenge
themselves the same way the world challenges us nowadays?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny that I produced more questions than original post even had.
Overall, despite my descriptions above I do like optimism and I do believe
that everything will be fine. People have got through a lot of bad stuff
and such jobs turmoil does not seem that major from this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

a substantial part of one’s life or even identity. At the same time the number of 
people in the movement is still small and, thus, most of the time we talk to
people who have no clue whatsoever about FIRE. As a result, one wonders quite often
whether they should share their FIRE story and explain the concept.
Let’s see arguments for and against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start - a little disclaimer. The life is very complex and multidimensional
and obviously the precise answer whether to share FIRE concept depends on a lot of factors
especially on the person who you consider sharing to. Thus, treat this as food for
thought and consider each situation on case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-have-a-lot-of-money&quot;&gt;“I have a lot of money”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching FIRE requires a substantial amount of money, which people outside of FIRE usually don’t
have. Even if you don’t tell this explicitly, a person can easily
deduce this fact from the concept itself. Basically, FIRE = “save a lot” and when
you say “I am into FIRE”, the other person can easily conclude that you want
to have a lot of money and you are on your way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly announcing having a lot of money can backfire. In the worst case the question
can be even about physical safety (highly depends on a country and the setup). In mild cases
this may give a wrong incentive to the other person. E.g. “oh, this person has a lot of
money, I should hang out with them, perhaps they are generous”. I.e. they could start liking
your money more than you and it may be tricky to distinguish the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially tricky in relationships. In many countries there are implicit 
assumptions that one party has to contribute more financially. If this person happens
to be into FIRE and their partner - not, this may sound like a jackpot for the non-FIRE partner.
Basically, from their perspective it is like “hey, I don’t plan to work and since I am considering spending my life with
you, you probably won’t need to work either”. Even when one does not have such dramatic
malicious incentives, they can still be appealed by your financial security and stability.
Again this does not sound right - one should like the person, not their financial state.
At the same time it is perfectly rational for them. If they want a good life for themselves
and their kids, having a very financially stable partner is the best. Thus, I do 
definitely understand their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can conclude that you should not tell that you are into FIRE to
people who you know poorly to avoid becoming a fruitful target for scams.
If you are in a relationship, consider delaying telling this too.
The idea is to be sure that your partner would be with you even
if you were not into FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust&quot;&gt;Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think that you have to eventually tell your partner
everything. First, otherwise it will be extremely hard to explain your 
lifestyle (I can’t even imagine any plausible attempt at this). Second,
if you can’t tell this, then you just don’t have enough trust and 
this suggests that the relationship has intrinsic problems. Obviously,
your case can differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember that trust begets trust (which I read
from “Search Inside Yourself” book, &lt;a href=&quot;/post/book-summary-search-inside-yourself&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
is my summary). Thus, by sharing
such an intricate and important detail of your life, you can improve
the state of the relationship and create a positive feedback loop of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective you should eventually tell about FIRE
people close to you and who you reasonably now and trust. Especially
in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unhealthy-reference-point&quot;&gt;Unhealthy reference point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I started to use this concept of reference points for happiness quite
a lot recently. I discovered it in “The Science of Wellbeing” course
(&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;my summary&lt;/a&gt;),
I also recommend to take the course, it is life changing). The idea is that
people are bad at absolute evaluations, so they compare relatively,
e.g. when they decide how good their life is. As a result, when they happen
to have unfortunately high basis for comparison (e.g. rich friend or
neighbor or even some movie actor), they become unnecessarily unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the same impression about FIRE. On the one hand, it can be
like a blessing in life. The move from blind
consumerism and working until state pension to having a concrete goal
and plan can improve one’s life greatly. On the other hand, it can
be a curse. For some people it can be very hard to rich FIRE
for various reasons. They could be okeyish with their current state.
E.g. they just have accepted it and got used to it. And then you
tell them that there is this way to not work and live happily and so on.
This can revive their inner struggle about their state. This can also
set unhealthy reference point for them: “Hey, my friend can reach that,
so I should be able too”. As a result, just knowing about FIRE existence
can make them unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also peculiar that reaching FIRE can actually be demanding in many ways.
One has actually to learn a lot, to control themselves, to manage their
finances, to plan everything for many years in the future. All of these
can be tricky. One can also easily become an outlier and lose their friends
and even their partner if they happen to disagree with the FIRE lifestyle.
Thus, by sharing the idea of FIRE, you may in some way force the other person
into all these difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time we are all grownups and theoretically should be able to make
our own decisions. Having one more option in life, one more theoretical way to move forward,
shouldn’t hurt that much. In the worst case, we can just drop the idea.
I think our brains are good at coming up with not always rational reasons to explain
whatever we want (this was mentioned during the “Science of Wellbeing” course too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally learned about FIRE by chance and extremely happy about it.
Not sure how I would feel about someone else convincing me. I would probably
assume that it is some Ponzi scheme or other scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, from this perspective, you may try to see how useful the idea of FIRE
will be for someone. If they will likely pursue it and be able to achieve
it, it should be ok to share. If they will just drop it as nonsense, this is 
fine too. If they are likely to get stuck in the middle - the idea is reasonable,
but not achievable - consider not sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally would rather not share and not “convert” people.
It is also partly due to reasons above - by sharing the concept
I will also tell others that I am into FIRE, which I prefer not to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meetups&quot;&gt;Meetups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there are FIRE oriented meetups, where everyone already knows the concept
and is in approximately similar situation. Thus, if you want to discuss FIRE
(e.g. roast your plan), you should consider attending something like this.
I did this couple times and it was very refreshing experience after years of
silence regarding FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

something. Somehow they focus on what could/should have been better in their life and this
makes them extremely unhappy. At the same time, from my perspective they are not doing that bad.
They are just too much into their fantasies instead of appreciating what they have.
Let’s look into into “no one has promised anything” and see some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observe surprisingly many people with a very specific attitude to life.
Usually they are quite unhappy with what they have and there is always plenty
of stuff they should have had instead. This can be being more beautiful,
smarter, healthier, wealthier (e.g. coming from a wealthier country),
having cooler car. Usually they use other people as a basis of their comparison.
E.g. “Alice is so beautiful and I am not so beautiful, why? This is unfair, 
what did she do for this? Am I worse than her?” or “Harold earns so much at his
startup and it is going so well for him, am I not as smart as him? Why don’t I
have a startup?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outside-our-control&quot;&gt;Outside our control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this wishes are directed to stuff fully outside of our control.
E.g. being more beautiful, coming from a wealthier family, being born
in a different country. Obviously being unhappy about this stuff is 
not rational at all. However, as I read in “Too soon old, too late smart”
(&lt;a href=&quot;/post/book-summary-too-soon-old&quot;&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt;) - 
it is very hard to change an opinion formed non-rationally (without logic)
with a rational (formal logical) arguments. This is definitely the case here.
I can occasionally feel something similar too, but I catch this pretty soon.
It is very healthy to try to change your reference points (as it was
suggested in the “Science of well being course”
(&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;my summary&lt;/a&gt;)).
E.g. there are many other things outside of your control which probably have
worked well, but could have been much worse. E.g. you are alive, this is
already pretty good. There are people, who have died already. Some even had completely
no control. Usually there are countries/people which are doing
much worse than you. So in some sense you were lucky to be born where you are
instead of there. There may be many features of your life, which
you don’t appreciate at all, but could. E.g. your have good relationship with
your parents. There are many people who don’t. Or your parents are not divorced.
Or they are even still alive. Or you like your job. Or you have a very nice hobby
and feel happy doing it. Basically by searching a bit and reflecting over your life
you can find plenty of examples where something could have been much worse, 
but it is pretty good. This definitely helps you to appreciate these things more.
This approach is also much healthier than trying to look at what could have
been better. There is no perfection. One can always be a bit
wealthier, healthier, smarter, more beautiful. Even after improving the desired
parameter a lot, one will just start desiring something else. Thus, in some sense
you could fight your desires now instead of being driven by them all your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inside-control&quot;&gt;Inside control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are some statements, which are somewhat inside our control.
E.g. why Harold has a great startup and I don’t. Perhaps he started the
startup and spent plenty of hours working on it. Perhaps he even failed
multiple times with his earlier ideas. Perhaps he was risking
bankruptcy or losing all his savings, but somehow he sticked to it.
Obviously, it does not mean that one is worse than Harold or that there 
is something intrinsic in one, which prevents them from having a startup.
However, if you don’t have a startup, then you probably didn’t do enough
to have a startup. Obviously, the state you desire is much better than what
you have now. E.g. current state + 1kk$ is better than current state.
However, 1kk$ can’t magically appear from nowhere. One has to do
something to earn them. Or e.g. you would be so happy to be able to speak
Italian. But you can’t magically start speaking Italian, you need to
exert effort for quite some time. Are you ready to invest this time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-one-promised-you-anything-in-life&quot;&gt;No one promised you anything in life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often when I hear people complaining in this fashion, I remind myself that
no one has promised them or me anything. They make this weird assumption that they
deserve something by just being alive and themselves. No, they don’t.
They are actually unbelievably happy to live in these times in their conditions.
There is no war around them. They are still alive. Reasonably healthy, both
physically and financially. The nature is actually extremely harsh and scary.
For some people the feeling of physical safety is so innate and obvious, that
they don’t even notice it anymore. While from the nature perspective, it is
a huge privilege. Imagine being a rabbit. You can be dead literally at any moment.
Did you injure a part of you body? Adieu, you are dead - there are no hospitals. Did you got unlucky
and happened to be at a wrong time at a wrong place - you are dead, there is no one
to protect you. You don’t have enough to eat? There is no social security and you
will likely starve to death. Did you happen to be around hunters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;yeap, you are dead and this is completely outside of your control. Humans have already
improved all of this greatly for themselves. The user experience of the modern human life
is just mind-blowing if you compare it to a rabbit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can see how much better your state is when compared to the raw nature.
But even in the human society there are situations where everything is much worse.
E.g. people starved a lot, fought wars, lost their everything due to natural disasters.
You are very likely not affected by any of this. And while it may look like you
are playing your life at hard difficulty (oh, going to work, having to do so
much, so many problems), when considered from this other perspective - it is actually easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when you find yourself in one of this unlucky situations, this is perfectly normal too.
No one has promised you anything. I do like asking people, who complain in this fashion:
“Did anyone promise you anything in life? I don’t remember something like that in my life”.
Theoretically I can be dead tomorrow and from general life perspective that is perfectly fine.
It is already a miracle that my body functions. Just imagine - it is a weird complex mechanism,
which we don’t even fully understand. And somehow it just works. I get a cut in my skin and it heals.
Completely on its own. Somehow magically. I get tired, then I sleep and feel refreshed again.
I eat and it is digested completely on its own. My brain does something and I get ideas
and can actually be productive. Also somehow magically. Like any of these details could
theoretically go wrong. There could be some weird disease or the brain would just decide to
not function well anymore. Or food could stop being digested. Or I could be dead tomorrow.
Or right now. And again this is perfectly fine from general life or nature perspective.
No one has promised me a specific lifespan or specific conditions in life. 
I am already extremely happy to have what I have now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-this-matter&quot;&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that it is their right of these people to be unhappy about their situation.
Some sense of unhappiness may be even good, because this is the first step to
improving. However, very often their complaints don’t result in anything productive.
Again - they are free to choose how to spend their time and energy. I just personally
try to avoid such complaints and find it useful to be able to detect such situations
and to get my brain out of them. When they are unhappy about things outside of their control,
they just can’t fix them anyway and, thus, this doesn’t make any sense.
E.g. being more beautiful. You have to work with what you have and I personally
like to accept that. I do have something, I could have had something better, but also
something worse. Thus, I will just do my best at getting the most from what I have.
When complaining about something inside their control, they usually reach a wrong conclusion.
Usually it is just “oh, life is so unfair, poor me”. In reality it should be “oh,
it seems like I like this thing a lot and want to reach this state, thus, I need to do something
and I will start right now”. Do you want to be able to speak Italian? The best way to achieve
this is to actually learn the language. Yes, one can dream about magically being able to speak
it, but this won’t help them at all to reach the goal. Thus, ignore stuff outside of your control.
For stuff inside your control - try to convert it into impulse to do something:
“hey, these people are dancing so nice, I would love to dance that well as well,
oh, I will go to a dancing school right now and start my classes”. Instead of
“oh, life is so unfair, I should have been able to dance easily, I should have had a talent,
I should have taken enough classes already” - you should have, but you didn’t, so just accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy remembering that no one has promised you anything!

just saying “get in the zone, then refuse to leave”.
Despite the simplicity of the advice and complete absence of any proof, this has
a profound positive effect on my productivity. Let’s see what this means for me
and why I think this works so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I completely by accident stumbled upon the following tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/refuse_to_leave_the_zone/tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;The initial tweet I saw&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/akirathedon/status/1152459994849091584&quot;&gt;the tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I don’t do everything people say to do in their tweets, but in this case
the advice just struck me and I did try it almost immediately. And it worked like a charm.
The tweet itself has a longer thread with more explanations. Basically the author
has been doing this for 200 days already. They get into the flow and then just try to stay there
as long as they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-this-works-for-me&quot;&gt;How this works for me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I preplan a list of tasks, like creating a playlist, but with work.
Then I start doing the first task in the list. Sometimes this can be hard (I can feel tired, not interested).
Often this can be a very small task (10-20 minutes). I also turn on my time tracking.
Very soon I finish the task and completely forget that I was tired or not interested.
The time has just likely passed like a lightning. And when finishing a task I use the advice from that tweet.
Instead of just turning off the time tracking and marking the task as done, I start to track time for
the next task. Then I quickly mark the previous task as done (the new task is being tracked already,
so I need to hurry up). Then I literally jump into the new task with no hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is peculiar that sometimes I have literally no clue how to solve the new task before I actually get to it.
E.g. writing a blog post without having a particular inspiration. If I didn’t try to stay in the zone,
it would be very easy to get scared. I would stop, think that I have no clue what to write and just
get distracted with something unproductive. Instead I just jump into it ASAP. My brain seems to be doing
something like “oh, we are in trouble, I need to quickly come up with some idea, ok, to mitigate
this unpleasant situation of being time tracked and having no clue what to do, I could &amp;lt;some surprising idea&amp;gt;”.
E.g. for blog posts I just quickly go through my list of topics I could write about and take the first
one which resonates with me. It is also peculiar that without staying in the zone I would hesitate which one
to take and would go through the list for much longer with plenty of doubt and multiple equally good options
to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I am able to do this for multiple hours, which was very surprising. Before 
I would struggle very badly and make a lot of breaks. I would also feel quite tired, but
once in the zone, I definitely don’t feel this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-works&quot;&gt;Why this works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to warn you - there will be a bunch of speculation ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main hypothesis is that starting doing something is hard.
E.g. it is evening and I know that I would love to do a couple of tasks,
but I still have some free time. So I could probably read something pointless somewhere
in the Internet for couple minutes before I start working and be just fine.
Or I am tired. I could go directly to bed. You see, a stuff like this could prevent me
from happily jumping into executing the tasks I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old approach didn’t take this into account at all, thus, didn’t work that well either.
Basically after completing a task I would make a couple minute break. Yeah, that’s what
people usually do - they do something and then they rest / have fun. The problem is that
I would get distracted and these 2 minutes easily become 10 or even hours. In the end I get to the square 1 - I
need to start again from this unproductive state with all the questions arising again 
(I am tired, should I go to sleep, I already did this one task, I should be fine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I stay in the flow, I just avoid all of this. The flow functions as a momentum to
get me through task switch. Instead of thinking much how I feel and whether I am tired,
I just start another task. By the way, flow feels amazing and once I am in the flow
it is much easier to achieve it in the next task (even if it would be impossible to do
with that task on its own).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach also encourages one to batch their work better,
i.e. to gather similar tasks into series and do them in one go.
E.g. if I write a blog post, I can then write a second one just
because I felt in the mood and was already warmed up for writing.
This saves me from ramping up for writing some other day and,
thus, improves my productivity. The author of the tweet also mentions
batching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just jumping to a task helps to fight perfectionism and analysis-paralysis.
It is easy to start reflecting before doing a task that e.g. I don’t know
what to do or there are multiple options, which are extremely hard to evaluate.
When staying in the flow and starting a task I have no time whatsoever for this.
The time tracking is already on, I already need to start doing something.
Obviously this may lower my quality bar (“let’s just do something”), but
I haven’t seen this being a problem. Instead I get reasonable results
while avoiding perfectionism and over-analysing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you to try this approach. I understand that we are all different
and the advice above may be life-changing for me, but completely useless for someone
else. Only you know how it is for you. Naturally I still occasionally feel not that well
and don’t even start with any tasks at all. Or I do get distracted before starting. The advice is not
a silver bullet, but still it has improved my productivity a lot and I do feel happier,
because I stay in the flow much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy staying in the zone &amp;amp; being hyperproductive!

I coined this term myself, but it is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_proof&quot;&gt;present&lt;/a&gt; in Wikipedia.
However, with a bit different meaning. In my case, the main idea was that the future
technology could improve and extract additional information from your current artifacts.
Let’s see couple examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dna&quot;&gt;DNA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned this concept originally in the context of DNA.
Currently analyzing one’s DNA provides some insights, but they are not too impressive.
Humanity still seems to lack deep understanding of how everything works.
At the same time, there are already many things one can do with their DNA.
The most obvious example - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.23andme.com/en-int/&quot;&gt;23andMe&lt;/a&gt;.
Spit in the box, send it their way and for $99 they will prepare a report with various
peculiar details discovered from your DNA. Alternatively one can search for their relatives
by their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here future proofness comes in play. These companies get access to one’s DNA to provide 
their services and currently cannot do much else. However, it may not be the case in the future.
One example - what if people learn to very reliably predict illnesses by DNA and then
insurance companies set their contributions based on such predictions. At the same time there can
be cases, which we currently even cannot imagine. Thus, from future proofness perspective
one should not give away their DNA, because in the future there may be a way to
extract sensitive data out of it. That’s why I personally feel uneasy about
using 23andMe. Some countries consider taking DNA on their border in some cases 
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/ice-considers-next-steps-in-dna-testing/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN about a similar idea in the US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of at least one example of poor future proofness having bad consequences for a person.
In 1970s there was a series of crimes with DNA left behind.
Recently this material was compared to data from online services for finding relatives based on DNA.
As a result a relative of a person, who committed the crimes, was matched.
In the end, the criminal was arrested. Thus, leaving DNA in 1970s happened to be 
not future proof.
Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/4/27/17290288/golden-state-killer-joseph-james-deangelo-dna-profile-match&quot;&gt;vox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptography&quot;&gt;Cryptography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where future proofness may play role is cryptography.
Imagine that you encrypt your data and store it in a cloud.
As a result the could provider theoretically has access to the encrypted 
version. Let’s say after 30 years the encryption method you used
is not secure anymore (e.g. computation power has grown so much or 
a vulnerability was discovered). As a result, the cloud provider
can now have access to your 30 year old data.
The value of this data can be questionable, but I can still imagine
this backfiring badly. Also the time span can be even shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is definitely not clear how to protect against this.
If with DNA we can avoid giving away the data, here this is trickier.
Theoretically we could store the data ourselves, but this is inconvenient.
Another option would be to use stronger encryption parameters.
However, I suspect that this will affect the performance really badly
and the future security improvement won’t be that large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photos-of-faces&quot;&gt;Photos of faces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another peculiar example is photos of faces.
Imagine that one publishes their photo or video where they
do questionable things (e.g. nudity or so). Their line of thought
might be that it is very unlikely that someone from their
immediate surrounding will discover this.
Somewhat recently reverse face search started to appear.
Basically one can upload a photo of a face and these sites show profiles in
social networks with faces matching the given photo. E.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17663640/socialmapper-facial-recognition-open-source-intelligence&quot;&gt;verge&lt;/a&gt; reports on one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is using masks which hide only part of one’s face.
It is very common in law enforcement to use masks which 
don’t cover eyes. Practicality of this design decision is hard to question.
I also agree that humans struggle with recognizing someone just by
their eyes. However, I could imagine some technology doing that pretty well
in the future. I am not aware of any examples yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-future-proofness-for-good&quot;&gt;Using future proofness for good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also examples where future proofness can be used for good.
Unfortunately in this case the term naming does not work well, but I will still keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Sapolsky in “Stress, Portrait of a Killer” (one of his documentaries) mentioned storing 
baboon samples frozen for years in case human develop better ways
to analyze them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryonics is fully based on this principle.
The idea is to somehow preserve a person in a reasonable state,
which could be reversed once the technology advances enough.
E.g. they can be terminally ill. Once they die according to the current
law, their body can be stored in a special way to minimize the damage
and to keep its structure. Once the technology advances far enough
to undo the effect of storage and also treat the original illness,
they can theoretically be revived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously one cannot protect against everything and there are always tradeoffs between
effort and security. At the same time, just knowing about the concept of 
future proofness can help one to avoid making questionable decisions.
It is also peculiar to notice this concept being at play in many unrelated
areas of life.&lt;/p&gt;

The old (current) system can be at times extremely confusing (e.g. mixing up
rings and zones when buying weekly tickets). Let’s see what has changed in the 
new system (mostly focusing on the inner city).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-info&quot;&gt;General info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official MVV page for the reform is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/ueber-den-mvv/der-verbund/mvv-tarifreform/&quot;&gt;here (German)&lt;/a&gt;.
It takes effect on 15.12.2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-tickets&quot;&gt;Existing tickets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should be careful with their existing tickets during the transition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existing bicycle, weekly- and monthy- tickets will be valid as normal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One way trip child / short and Streifenkarte are valid until 31.03.2020.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The remaining ones (one way trip adult, one day (single, group, child) ticket) are not valid anymore.
One can exchange them for the new tickets for free until 31.03.2020 (and for 2 Euro processing fee afterwards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changes&quot;&gt;Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;zones&quot;&gt;Zones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zone layout has been changed dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new layout is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/mediapool/07-Ueber_den_MVV/Tarifstrukturreform/2020_layout_S_U_R_T_X.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is convenient to compare it with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/mediapool/03-Plaene_Bahnhoefe/Netzplaene/MVV_Netzplan_S_U_R.pdf&quot;&gt;the old S-Bahn layout&lt;/a&gt;.
If you feel really extreme, you could try comparing it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/mediapool/03-Plaene_Bahnhoefe/Tarifplaene/MVV_Tarifplan_Gesamtnetz.pdf&quot;&gt;the old entire network scheme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/mvv_reform/old_entire_network.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old entire network scheme which has too many details to be readable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig: old entire network scheme screaming “You shall not pass!”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is one mega zone called M (for Munich), which covers the inner parts of the city.
In addition to M, there are 6 other zones named simply with numbers from 1 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously there was definitely a mess with different kinds of areas. There were
rings (1-16), zones (white, green, yellow and red) and areas (inner district, Munich XXL, outer area).
Thus, having {M, 1, …, 6} is definitely much simpler than what we had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the mapping, the old inner district (Innenraum, i.e. old rings 1-4) is a subset of the new M zone.
In other words M zone does not only fully cover Innerraum, but also includes some additional stops. 
For example, some of the stops now are both in M and 1, while before they were either not in Innenraum at all (e.g. Deisenhofen)
or fully inside Innenraum (e.g. Neuperlach Süd, Neubiberg). This is definitely good, since people traveling
to such stops won’t have to cross a zone border, which makes their tickets cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also peculiar that now often 3-5 stops on the zone border belong to both zones (previously mostly 1-2).
This is also very good for customers based on the same reason as above - it is cheaper to travel to such stops from both zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/mvv_reform/5_stops_in_both_zones.png&quot; alt=&quot;5 stops in both M and 1 zones&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig: 5 stops belonging both to M and 1. Woohoo!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prices&quot;&gt;Prices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing has changed as well. Surprise-surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new official pdf is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/mediapool/07-Ueber_den_MVV/Tarifstrukturreform/2020_MVV_Preisblatt_Haltestelle.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The old pricing can be deduced from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/mediapool/03-Plaene_Bahnhoefe/Tarifplaene/MVV_Tarifplan_Innenraum.pdf&quot;&gt;the entire network poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Single trip ticket” is now more expensive (3.30€ vs. 2.90€ before).
E.g. a trip from Hbf to Fröttmaning is 3.30€, but was 2.90€ (when bought as a “Single trip ticket”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price for Streifenkarte didn’t change though - it is still 14.00€ for 10 stripes.
Thus, now they are even more lucrative. Before one was saving only 2.90 - 2.80 = 0.1€ per trip,
now it becomes 3.30 - 2.80 = 0.5€.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily ticket prices grow as well.
Before one would pay 6.7€ for single daily ticket for Innenraum and 12.8€ for group..&lt;br /&gt;
The new prices are 7.8€ and 14.8€ respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the weekly tickets, the new system is now cheaper.
For example Hbf to Fröttmaning single weekly ticket (Rings 1-4) used to cost 22.1€, but will become 17.1€.
The same is true for monthly tickets. Rings 1-4 monthly ticket used to cost 79.1€ and now it is 55.20€.
This is exactly what Rings 1-2 monthly ticket costs in the old system (i.e. these people get to travel much
more for the same money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For longer trips, the prices (assuming using Streifenkarte) also mostly go down or stay the same.
E.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/mediapool/07-Ueber_den_MVV/Tarifstrukturreform/190111_MVV-Tarifreform_2020_-Hintergrunddosier.pdf&quot;&gt;a pdf with background details of the reform&lt;/a&gt; (page 11) has a peculiar sample S-Bahn trip prices scheme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/mvv_reform/smoother_sbahn_pricing.png&quot; alt=&quot;MVV sample scheme showing smoother pricing curve for longer S-Bahn trips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig: the prices are now smoother!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the pricing curve gets smoother across zones. In some cases, now one has to pay less
than they would before due to more granular zone structure (7 new ones vs ~3 old ones). In other words, they get
to pay more proportional to what they use. E.g. before Hbf - Dachau used to cost 5.6€ and not it is 4.2€ (assuming Streifenkarte).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occasional “1-2 trips per day, but very rarely” travelers will observe no changes in their spendings
(assuming they use Streifenkarte). People who travel a lot, but only occasionally, i.e. 
“3+ trips per day, but rarely” will start paying more due to increased daily ticket prices.
People who travel frequently and a lot (i.e. weekly and monthly ticket users) will benefit
from lower prices and pay less (or travel further for the same money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I definitely like the simplicity of the new approach. 
Previously it was very easy to mix up rings with areas (i.e. buy 1-2 Ring weekly ticket and
assume that it works for Innenraum).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentives&quot;&gt;Incentives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new system incentivizes people much more to use Streifenkarte.
It also makes weekly and monthly tickets more lucrative.
It is a bit unfortunate that visitors will often have to pay more.
It often makes no sense for them to buy an entire Streifenkarte or they may not even know
that it costs less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy simplified travels with the new reform!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">MVV (Munich public transport company) changes their pricing structure on 15.12.2019.

While the title sounds extremely fishy (I suppose that this “X things blablabla” is used a lot by cheap article
websites with low quality content), the book itself was overall surprisingly good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of chapters with weird content (or without much meaning behind it).
E.g. military story about fixing the map. Some were more like autobiography, which is by
itself fine and even was interesting to read, but it didn’t add much to the book.
At the same time, some chapters were extremely good, especially about psychological
problems and requiring too much control in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 4/5 (couple chapters are not that good, the remainder is very deep and insightful,
overall, I recommend, especially for programmers and engineers who feel like they require too much
control in life)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-if-the-map-does-not-agree-with-the-ground-the-map-is-wrong&quot;&gt;1. If the map does not agree with the ground, the map is wrong.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build “maps” in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-we-are-what-we-do&quot;&gt;2. We are what we do.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not what we think, say or how we feel.
Similarly other people - don’t look at what they promise,
but how they behave.
Past behavior is the most reliable predictor of future behavior.
People get not what they deserve, but what they expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;something to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;someone to love&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;something to look forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“work” - any activity, paid or unpaid that gives us a feeling of personal significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are scared to take risks -&amp;gt; boredom -&amp;gt; abundance of meaningless entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love someone when the importance of his or her needs and desires rises to the level
of our own (or even exceeds). Would you take a bullet for that person?
“Love” can be seen in amount and quality of the time we give others.
Love is demonstrated behaviorally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He does inconceivable things, but I know he loves me” makes no sense, can you intentionally
hurt someone you love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love requires courage to become totally vulnerable to another person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-it-is-difficult-to-remove-by-logic-an-idea-placed-there-not-by-logic-in-the-first-place&quot;&gt;3. It is difficult to remove by logic an idea placed there not by logic in the first place.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We operate in the world mostly on autopilot.
People can satisfy their emotional needs through others (abusing them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children often feel like they own something to their parents. They owe them nothing.
It was our own decision to bring them into this world, providing for them is
a task of a parent, not a selfless act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-functioning families are good at letting their children go.
Poorly - tend to hold on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ignorance is invincible. People can get so deep into their view,
that they ignore any evidence against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-the-statute-of-limitations-had-expired-on-most-of-our-childhood-traumas&quot;&gt;4. The statute of limitations had expired on most of our childhood traumas.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causality is reinterpreted constantly as we try to explain how we became ourselves.
We want to learn from personal stories to avoid repeating mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of responsibility for what we do now requires an act of will, it is easier to blame
past (ourselves, parents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t give much direct advice, my job is to sit with the clients, while they
figure out what they need to do to make themselves better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therapists help better people who are like them. E.g. therapy in other country 
is much harder even when the therapists knows the language perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-any-relationship-is-under-control-of-the-person-who-cares-the-least&quot;&gt;5. Any relationship is under control of the person who cares the least.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People choose each other by sexual attraction and “enlightened” self interest
evaluating other person by: education, earning potential, shared interests,
trustworthiness, philosophy of life. This creates expectations,
failure of which dissolves the relationship with time.
“Chemistry” of “falling in love” = (in retrospect) readiness, lust,
hope. Argument supporting this: absence of evidence of persistence
of this chemistry over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is discouraging to see a couple about to join their lives acting like
purchasers of used cars (prenups). Contract = people don’t trust each other,
they protect against taking advantage.
Marriage problems are rarely symmetrical. It takes two people 
to create a relationship and only one to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine saying to newly weds “the chances of this marriage enduring are no 
better than 50/50. What makes you think you will win this coin flip?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-feelings-follow-behavior&quot;&gt;6. Feelings follow behavior.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t control how we feel or what we think.
The successful treatment of alcoholism and other addictions has shown that affected
people are obligated to do something (i.e. refuse to drink or use other substances to control
their addiction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to destigmatize genuine mental illness, we created many diagnoses that are descriptions
of certain patterns of behavior (e.g. ADD). The term “disabled” when applied to substance abusers removes
responsibility for one’s problems and irrevocably damages self respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compensating helplessness validates it and creates incentive to surrender one’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While medication can provide relief (sometimes crucial), people also have obligation
to alter their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-be-bold-and-might-forces-will-come-to-your-mind&quot;&gt;7. Be bold and might forces will come to your mind.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-the-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-the-good&quot;&gt;8. The perfect is the enemy of the good.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are taught to pursue an elusive form of security, through 
acquisition of material goods and the means to obtain them.
Also to form intimate relationships for access to sex, forming stable economic
unit, ability to parent. Problem: to control our own lives we must exert control over the 
lives of others -&amp;gt; this leads to a zero sum game. We live in competitive society (e.g. capitalism).
As a result we see the world through “win or lose”. 
Control is a popular illusion, closely related to the pursuit of perfection.
Perfectionists don’t trust feeling and prefer things they can count.
This obsession to details is good at work, but can be insufferable in personal lives.
I treat a lot of engineers, accountants, programmers.
Less control in their jobs would make the ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradox of perfection: in some settings (notably, in our intimate relationships),
we gain control only by relinquishing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-lifes-two-most-important-questions-are-why-and-why-not&quot;&gt;9. Life’s two most important questions are “Why” and “Why not”.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is knowing which one to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates: the unexamined life is not worth living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self examination requires hard work and can lead to 
embarrassment. We think that our behavior is a matter of
conscious choice. 
Acknowledge existing of repressed desires, resentments and motivations
below our consciousness. Ignoring existence of subconscious leads to
destructive pattern of behavior repeating the same mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding partner in middle years of life is harder
(e.g. even boy/girlfriend sounds inappropriate for 40 years old -&amp;gt; social stigma).
Many choose loneliness instead of meeting new people (but risking rejection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“what is the biggest chance you have ever taken?” makes you think how risk averse you are.
People don’t expect to get good a skiing without falling down, but are surprised by a struggle to find someone
to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-our-greatest-strengths-are-our-greatest-weaknesses&quot;&gt;10. Our greatest strengths are our greatest weaknesses.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedication to work, attention to detail, ability to manage time, conscientiousness 
-&amp;gt; correlated with success, but difficult for other person to live with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, who demands much of themselves, has high standards for others.
Different roles (friend, worker, partner) demand different attitudes.
Often obsessive person (man) meets impulsive (woman) to compensate each other.
As a result, he asks “why can’t you be more responsible” and she “you just don’t
know how to have fun”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compulsive character people are prone to depression (seeking perfection in imperfect
world). They put a lot on control. Everything threatening this induces anxiety.
They try to regain control and make the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything in life is a good &amp;amp; bad news story (at the same time)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;11-the-most-secure-prisons-are-those-we-construct-for-ourselves&quot;&gt;11. The most secure prisons are those we construct for ourselves.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We voluntarily trap ourselves
and don’t do what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success stories make our inadequacy stronger.
There is plenty of advice.
“One would think that we are engaged in an orgy of self-improvement”.
But people just keep doing what they used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can do anything, we must be able to imagine it.
We got used to expect a quick fix for our problems (&amp;amp; changing ourselves).
“Lottery mentality”. People dream instead of taking action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your plan to do something is a real expression of intent or simply a wish?
Alteration of attitudes and behavior is slow, change is incremental.
Look at any prison break (imagination, planning, slow progress).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mistake thoughts, wishes and intentions for actual change.
“I love you” without consistently loving behavior is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay too much attention to words, and not enough to actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;12-the-problems-of-elderly-are-frequently-serious-but-seldom-interesting&quot;&gt;12. The problems of elderly are frequently serious but seldom interesting.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society believes that old people can’t bring anything useful -&amp;gt; segregation.
This is a result of human fear of mortality.
Old people play along - most are preoccupied with self centered complaints.
They are seen as a burden by younger relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The stratification of society along age lines is one of its
most rigid divisions”.
Old people self segregate (migrate to warm places for older people).
They avoid contact with young and mental stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;13-happiness-is-the-ultimate-risk&quot;&gt;13. Happiness is the ultimate risk.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being depressed is safe - you have low expectations, thus, hard to disappoint.
To be happy: taking risk to lose this happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All significant accomplishments require risk. Society is risk averse
and promotes achieving safety.
Our feelings depend on (mainly) our interpretation of what happens.
It is not “what”, but how we respond determines how we feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were now heading into the wind, so I got behind my father
and he broke the wind for me” - a cute story about a child running with his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;14-true-love-is-the-apple-of-eden&quot;&gt;14. True love is the apple of Eden.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People require no justification when falling in love.
They do require one when breaking apart. 
This is an educational problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I think of all the crap I learned in high school it is a wonder
that I can think at all”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important task of choosing who to fall in love with becomes another
example of trial and error (with costly trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is a compensation for harshness of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;15-only-bad-things-happen-quickly&quot;&gt;15. Only bad things happen quickly.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most familiar behaviors resistant to change are addictions.
Virtually all happiness producing processes in our lives take long time:
learning, changing old behavior, building relationship, raising children.
This is why patience and determination are among life’s primary virtues.
Consumption society (ads) -&amp;gt; instant gratification (e.g. through material stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16-not-all-who-wander-are-lost&quot;&gt;16. Not all who wander are lost.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education: follow instructions, please others, obey the rules -&amp;gt; happiness will be yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;17-unrequited-not-returned-love-is-painful-but-not-romantic&quot;&gt;17. Unrequited (not returned) love is painful but not romantic.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Love at first sight” is another popular fantasy, which sets up for disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;18-there-is-nothing-more-pointless-or-common-than-doing-the-same-things-and-expecting-different-results&quot;&gt;18. There is nothing more pointless or common than doing the same things and expecting different results.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistakes are a consequence of being a human and constitute an essential element of trial 
and error. Making same mistakes again is frustrating. E.g. failure rate of second
marriage is &amp;gt; 50% (i.e. more than the failure rate of the first marriage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of learning consists not so much in accumulating answers as in figuring out how 
to formulate the right questions. That’s why psychotherapy is “Questions &amp;amp; Answers”. Much human
behavior is driven by intentions below the level of our awareness (needs, desires,
past experiences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every human action is in some way an expression of how we think about ourselves. This criterion
can be applied to any important life decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How will this make me feel about myself?”. How does it make you feel being with
a particular person? 
Is it “you make me want to be a better man?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people have a low expectation of happiness. “They regard any lasting sense of joy as a romantic
ideal pronounced by the entertainment industry. This disillusionment is a major barrier to change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people can’t be expected to take emotional risks in pursuit of goals, which they think are impossible”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denial is a way for people to lie to themselves.
This disables us entirely from making necessary changes.
“Nothing is so beautiful as a promise right after it is given.”
Another kind of self lies, e.g. New Year resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an act of laziness to ascribe to luck most of what happens to us.
Life decisions not based on reality are bound to be faulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People cheat a lot in marriage (@40 years - men 50-65%, women 35-45%). People seek reassurance
(apart from variety) that they retain their attractiveness
(due to fear of death).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are genetically programmed to question authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I ask people in conflict to withhold criticism of those
around them to see if this changes the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People assume (falsely) that the goal of parents of to shape
behavior through instructions (rules and punishments).
Passive resistance is the last refuge of the powerless.
Assembly line workers who cannot strike can slow down.
Children can demonstrate their unhappiness by not doing what they
are told. They can’t challenge openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually parents persist and double down on their approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually such people struggle to communicate with their spouse too.
Judgmental people are often raised in judgmental families. Thus, this is in their
habits. The idea, that it is possible to live without criticizing and directing
everyone around us, is a novel one for many people. Even short period without
criticizing leads to relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often parents transmit only their anxiety, uncertainty and fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of parenting (beyond keeping safe and loved) is to
convey to children a sense that it is possible to be happy in an uncertain world
(to give them hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;24-the-major-advantage-of-illness-is-that-it-provides-relief-from-responsibility&quot;&gt;24. The major advantage of illness is that it provides relief from responsibility.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic animal psychology - any reinforced behavior will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are surprised when I ask about advantages of their problem.
People often do a lot to fulfill their expectations of themselves
(e.g jobs they hate). Illness is one of few socially acceptable ways to lower
expectations (avoid responsibility). Most people don’t notice this and
are preoccupied by disadvantages. This benefit might reinforce sick role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer one is disabled, the greater the chance that the illness will become
part of their identity.
These are subconscious -&amp;gt; dangerous.
The rise of effective somatic treatments contributed to the sense that healing
happens to us rather than we take part actively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each person is responsible for the choices he or she makes in our never ending
quest for happiness and retains its power as a instrument of transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;25-we-are-afraid-of-the-wrong-things&quot;&gt;25. We are afraid of the wrong things.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a fear promoting society. It is the business of advertisers to stroke 
our anxieties. A dissatisfied consumer is more apt to buy. Same for news.
One of the things that define us is what we worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001 people sold a lot of stocks and stopped flying. Even in good times the public
perception of the risk of becoming a crime victim is exaggerated.
We arm ourselves and ignore that family members are the most likely victims of the guns we buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile - smoking, overeating, not fastening seat belts, social injustice, 
people we elect - provoke little anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relations with each other are characterized by mistrust.
We often behave as life is a competition that we can only win at 
the expense of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear can be an adaption emotion, if it results in actions, that protect
us from harm. But threats must be realistically identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear and desire are opposite sides of the same coin.
Much of what we do is driven by feat of failure.
E.g. pursuing material wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;26-parents-have-a-limited-ability-to-shape-childrens-behavior-except-for-the-worse&quot;&gt;26. Parents have a limited ability to shape children’s behavior, except for the worse.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People take responsibility for their children successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However (except abuse), parents are not responsible for the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children can be raised successfully under a variety of parental regimes
(from authoritarian to permissive).
Children need to feel loved and respected. It is important to set 
limits around safety and aggression.
What we say pales in comparison with what our children see us do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to find evidence that world is bad and going to hell.
Bad news are more interesting, so there is incentive to deliver them to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems surprising that we are not all clinically depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to be happy? Selective attention.
Focus energy and awareness on things and people that bring us pleasure
and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;27-the-only-real-paradises-are-those-we-have-lost&quot;&gt;27. The only real paradises are those we have lost.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia for an idealized past is common and usually harmless.
However, it can distort our attempts to come to terms with the present.
It is often in contrast to what we have now.
Things were not really better long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cumulative burdens of our imperfect lives are harder to bear
as we weaken in body and spirit. Our yearning for the past is fueled
by a selective memory of our younger-selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know someone fully and love them in spite of, even because of,
their imperfections is an act that requires us to recognize and forgive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two very important indicators of emotional maturity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can do this for others, we may be able to do it for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our constant challenge is not to seek perfection in ourselves and others,
but to find ways to be happy in an imperfect world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are impeded in this effort if we cling to an idealized vision of the past.
This ensures dissatisfaction with the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory is not accurate transcription of past events.
It is rather a story we tell ourselves about the past, full of distortions,
wishful thinking and unfulfilled dreams.
What and how we remember are affected by the meaning of events to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common for people to have someone in their past whom they 
recall with longing and regret, someone whom they adversely compare all subsequent
relationships. This person can be a parent, a first love or a friend no longer here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their perfection, like that of funeral eulogy, is a function of selective memory that
can no longer be tested by daily contact.
They exist in a sort of distracting dream with which people now in our lives
cannot compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this distracts us from our efforts to extract
pleasure and meaning from the present.
We are haunted by paths not taken especially our missed opportunities for perfect love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;28-of-all-the-forms-of-courage-the-ability-to-laugh-is-the-most-profoundly-therapeutic&quot;&gt;28. Of all the forms of courage, the ability to laugh is the most profoundly therapeutic.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People find it hard to entertain two emotions simultaneously.
Antidote to anxiety - to relax skeletal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacity for laugher is one of two characteristics that separate us from other animals (other one is
contemplating our own death).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to be happy in the face of our own mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence that humor heals (e.g. Nomman Cousins book).
Humor is also a form of sharing, an interpersonal exercise.
To share laughter is a way of affirming that we are all in this lifeboat together.
The sea surrounds us; rescue is uncertain; control is illusory. Still we sail on - together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pessimists are right in the long run. Nobody gets out of here alive.
But it contains self fulfilling prophecies. Others respond accordingly
when we are hostile and confirm our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;29-mental-health-requires-freedom-of-choice&quot;&gt;29. Mental health requires freedom of choice.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any emotional disorder - constraint in some way.
Cardinal rule of anxiety: avoidance makes it worse;
confrontation gradually improves it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health is a function of choice. The more choices we are able to exercise, the happier we are likely to be.
We are never out of choices, no matter how desperate the circumstances are.
We are not dead yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;30-forgiveness-is-a-form-of-letting-go-but-they-are-not-the-same-thing&quot;&gt;30. Forgiveness is a form of letting go, but they are not the same thing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of habits and conditioned responses that renders us unique serves as a kind of gyroscope
lending our responses to life a predictability that is of value both to us and to those
who seek to know us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people choose religion as a basis for their hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those like me (unable or unwilling to relinquish our skepticism about easy answers to large
questions) are left with task of living with uncertainty.
Some form of forgiveness is the end point of grieving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people the past is like an endlessly entertaining, if frequently painful movie,
they replay for themselves over and over. It may be our imagination.
We cannot change it.&lt;/p&gt;

It definitely raised couple interesting issues (one should drop
unimportant areas to be able to reach something reasonable in more important areas).
However, how to understand what to drop was not that clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book suggests to try to understand whether what you are doing has some future and the
tough period you are getting through is just temporary. The idea is to drop everything
with no future and focus only on one the most important thing. This allows you to get through the 
dip (the time when there is little progress and everything is hard). Also quiting is fine,
one just need to quit at the right time (before sinking a bunch of time).
However, the book does not tell that well how to identify which projects have future and which do not.
I agree that it is a useful perspective (one should focus, quitting may not mean failing),
but the trickiest part for me is to assess the future of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 3/5 (high level ideas are good + book is very short,
but not extremely actionable. Overall, I can slightly recommend)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quiting-is-ok&quot;&gt;Quiting is ok&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winner-takes-all&quot;&gt;Winner takes all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture celebrates superstars.
#1 can get 10x of #10 or 100x of #100. This reminds of Zipf’s law. 
Marketplace loves the winner. Thus, choosing the top is less risky.
At the same time, it is hard to get to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best can be the local best (i.e. recommended by friends, cheap, best in town).
Best is subjective.
However, if there are too many (infinity) options, then it is hard to choose
and easy to go for “the best”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average is invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In school one learns to be well-rounded. This is wrong. E.g. when you choose a doctor,
what are you looking for? Only how they do the relevant for you tasks (i.e. medicine).
Also we are taught to pick lowest hanging fruits and give up if it is too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not going to get to #1, you might as well quit now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-situations&quot;&gt;Types of situations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dip&quot;&gt;The Dip&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start something, it is fun.
The Dip is an effort screen to keep unmotivated people out.
It is easy to be a CEO, but hard to get there. Otherwise there would be too many
of them. Scarcity is the secret to value. The Dip creates value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dips give you opportunity to get ahead of your competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dip is the reason you are here. People and organizations fight the Dip by diversification.
It is easier to be mediocre than to confront reality and quit.
Knowing that you’re facing a dip is the first step in getting through. 
Rule: if you can’t get through the dip, don’t start.
Being 98% good is not enough, your competitors are 1 click away (in the Internet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-cul-de-sac-dead-end&quot;&gt;The Cul De Sac (dead end)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work and nothing happens (neither worse nor better).
Quit. This leads to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-cliff&quot;&gt;The Cliff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you smoke, the harder it is to quit.
Quit. This leads to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/book_summary_the_dip/types.png&quot; alt=&quot;Three kinds of situations illustration.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choose-correct-dips&quot;&gt;Choose correct dips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either don’t start or get through the dip.
The stupid thing is to waste time and money by quiting at the dip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentivized-quitting&quot;&gt;Incentivized quitting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many systems benefit from people quiting (“Neflix”, gym).
Companies can intentionally lengthen the Dip to fight new competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-through-the-dip-by-quitting&quot;&gt;Getting through the dip by quitting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quiting frees your resources to go through the dip in the other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need strategic quitting instead of reactive and serial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting up is thrilling, but your effort pays off only when you get through
the dip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dip is flexible. It reacts to your action. Once you are ready
to quit, you have nothing to lose. This can be powerful.
Quiting usually = short term focus.
We learn “If it hurts - stop” -&amp;gt; short term pain has more impact, so it is important to
amplify long term benefits of not quiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind yourself of life at the other end of the dip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// The author often mentions these two (from my perspective) contradicting ideas - “quitting is hard to face” and
at the same time - “not quiting at the dip is hard”. I think this can be resolved by assuming that in the first
case one continue being mediocre and does not want to accept that this does not lead anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quit dead-ends, cliffs and dips not worth the rewards. Quitting is essential for sticking to the right projects.
Alternatively you settle for being average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quitting != failing.
Failing = give up or no other options left or quiting too often (which takes all your resources).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coping never leads to exceptional performance. Coping wastes time and misdirects your energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quitting as a short-term strategy is bad. Quitting for the long-term is an excellent idea.
“Never quit something with great long-term potential just because you can’t deal with the
stress of the moment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is the enemy of quitting.
But hurting one’s pride by quitting is not fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about quitting is already a great start.
Then think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am I panicking?
 Panic is never premeditated. The best quitters decide in advance
 when they are going to quit. You can always quit later, so wait until
 you’re done panicking to decide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who am I trying to influence?
 If you consider quitting, then you likely fail to influence some party.
 One person has different “threshold” from a market (too much persistence to
 influence one person = bothering). 
 Most people in the market have never heard about you.
 Influencing one person is like scaling a wall.
 A market is more like a hill. You can make a little progress bit by bit.
 It gets easier the higher you are (e.g. people talk to each other).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What sort of measurable progress am I making?
You either move forward, fall behind or stand still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much cheaper and easier to build your foundation in one market than to flit from
one to another until you find a quick success. Quitting a job is not quitting your
quest to make a living. It is not giving up. It is just a tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistence is good when you move through/across the market.
This doesn’t work with a bad job though.
Quiting before your start - write down under what circumstances you are willing to quit and when.
Then stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are making a decision based on how you feel at the moment, you will probably make the
wrong decision.
E.g. you can talk yourself into quitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How dare you to settle for mediocre just because you are busy with too many things on your agenda?
If it’s not going to put a dent in the world, quit. Use that void to find the energy to
assault the Dip that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;approach-summary&quot;&gt;Approach summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is this a dip, cliff or cul de sac? How can I change cul de sav into dip?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is my persistence going to pay off in the long run?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When should I quit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I am going to quit anyway, is there something dramatic I could do that might change the game?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What chances does this project have to be the best in the world?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who decides what best is?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we make the “world” smaller?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short books are hard to write, write less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We succeed when we do something remarkable. We fail when we give up too soon. 
We succeed when we are the best in the world at what we do.
We fail when we get distracted by tasks we don’t have the guts to quit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="book summary" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">I read “The Dip” by Seth Godin.

Overall, it was quite an interesting way to approach
marketing nowadays + very motivating to be riskier and experiment more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book gives an interesting approach to doing modern marketing by being remarkable (unusual). 
The arguments are definitively anecdotal, but overall felt reasonable.
I tool a couple of ideas from it and plan to apply them in my projects.
The book also discusses early stages of a product development and 
being more risky and experimenting more. I found this quite motivating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 4/5 (not bad, +1 point for being motivating.
Definitely not a waste of time, but hard to actively recommend.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;old-marketing-is-no-more&quot;&gt;Old marketing is no more&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can no longer market directly to masses. Products are invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people can’t buy your product. Either they don’t have money, time or don’t want it. There are far more
choices nowadays and less time to sort them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets are over-satisfied, so word of mouth is not that popular anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old rule was: create safe ordinary products and combine them with great marketing.
The new rule is: create remarkable products which the right people seek out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All successful marketing companies are very different. The only thing they have in common is remarkability 
(and being an outlier). People are blind to old school ads. You have to create something remarkable and be
more bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author calls a remarkable product a Purple Cow (hereinafter, Cow).
Cow is the only way to grow your business these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author multiple times calls products which provide more value remarkable.
I personally found this weird, because the product is just better that’s what attracts people. 
It is obvious that when you have a much better product, it is easier for people to choose it
(they are incentivized to do so in some sense). Yes, you can call this remarkable, but
“make better products” mantra is obvious without calling it “remarkable”.
In particular, an elevator example. Some company was installing elevators with their own
scheduling system, which worked much better than others. This worked well for the company and the author
calls them remarkable. Technically true…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adoption&quot;&gt;Adoption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, your product gets picked up by innovators. Then early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/book_summary_purple_cow/adoption_curve.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adoption curve illustration. First a small number of innovators adopt your product. Then early adopters (more).
Then early and late majority (the major part of all the adopters). Finally, small portion of laggards.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is going to eagerly adapt to your product.
You need people who like new and change. Early adopters are the ones who will “sell” it further.
Being remarkable helps to attract early adopters and helps them to spread it further
(makes it easier).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;idea-virus&quot;&gt;Idea-virus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea is like a virus. You need “sneezers” (experts sharing to others) to spread it.
Create an idea virus for a small niche.
Product made for everybody is made for nobody.
When choosing the niche, consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How easy it is to spread your idea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How tight is the group you are targeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product needs to be designed virus-worthy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertise where your customers (sneezers) are actively looking for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one in the market listens, you can leave or launch a series of Cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differentiate your customers - e.g. most profitable group, most likely to sneeze and so on.
Reward sneezing group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;playing-safe-is-risky-dont-be-boring&quot;&gt;Playing safe is risky. Don’t be boring.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools teach us to play safe - not falling behind, not standing out.
If you don’t stand out, you don’t attract criticism. We mistakenly believe that
criticism leads to failure. Criticism of project != of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t know whether Cow is going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being boring is risky.
Following someone doing a breakthrough won’t work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many products are built to appeal to as many people as possible.
This is not interesting for innovators and for majority either (not enough adoptance
yet for them to adopt).
Mass products are expensive to create, thus, taking risk (experimenting) with them is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World is very turbulent, people tend to safety and this is actually more risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider experimenting with the users changing their standard behavior to make the product work
dramatically better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If future of a product is unlikely to be remarkable, kill it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-with-cow&quot;&gt;What to do with Cow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have Cow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Milk” it as much as you can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to build a replacement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get benefits of Cow even when it becomes boring (your product is already popular).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling new stuff to people who love you is easier and cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get popular, you stop being remarkable - everyone just chooses you.
This is also a way to kill Cow for profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cow is a stage in product life cycle, you can’t be there all the time
(too risky and expensive), but when you get something new or need to grow that’s what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-cow&quot;&gt;Building Cow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Very good” is rarely remarkable.
Remarkable = bad or unexpectedly good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your product appears in parody, then likely there is Cow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either work on Cow or do nothing - mediocre half measures (e.g. rebrandings) just make harder for existing sneezers
to spread your product. You should look for people with otaku [(wiki)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku]] - actively
eager to try your product (take the risk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no 100% recipe for Cow. Go for cutting edge (in product, pricing, packaging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slogan helps sneezers to spread.
E.g. Pisa tower is very easy to describe, so it is popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A compromise can’t be risky. Thus, Cow can’t be built by a committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect emails of people you impress with your Cow, to present them the next Cow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product needs to be built remarkable (i.e. built to support easy marketing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier to develop a product if you yourself have an otaku (~obsession) for it.
Sometimes this is not enough and you need to either imagine what your fans want or iterate a lot and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be outrageous. This can sometimes work, but mostly just annoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkable != big. Rather unusual (“unsafe”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap is the last resort Cow (but tricky due to price war).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you measure something, it will improve”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cow-in-job-search&quot;&gt;Cow in job search&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can apply Cow when looking for a job.
Just sending your resume is “boring”.
Instead you should be so remarkable that you don’t even need a resume.
Do a great job while you are not looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;address-the-niche&quot;&gt;Address the niche&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“South park” scored 1.5/10 with women, but the group that mattered for the series found it to be a great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your product needs to be irresistible to a small group.&lt;/p&gt;
