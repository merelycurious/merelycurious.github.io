Here is my impression (pretty mixed and rather on the negative side) and summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book felt weird and very wordy. Basically the author developed their own theory about what makes one to like their job
and how to reach this state. These ideas seemed reasonable and somewhat obvious. However, there was no attempt to prove anything
any only ~10 anecdotes instead, which do illustrate the point, but does not prove it. One could easily ignore all the anecdotes.
Also closer to the end the book started listing somewhat random advice from other books. Overall, the content could have been compressed 10-20x without losing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 2/5 (this wasn’t a complete waste of time, but quite wasteful, I can’t recommend this book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-your-passion-is-harmful&quot;&gt;“Follow your passion” is harmful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are used to hear “follow your passion” advice from everywhere as a way to choose your career.
However, this is wrong. Even Steve Jobs said the same advice, but his own story was different.
If he had followed his passion, there would have been no Apple. Do what Steve Jobs did, not what he 
said to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Follow your passion” has been started with a book “What Color is Your Parachute?” by Bolles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion advice is dangerous, because it makes you feel that there is a perfect job and that
you will immediately recognize it. This leads to excessive career hoping and unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-job&quot;&gt;Great job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self Determination Theory explains intrinsic work motivation needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autonomy - control over your day and feeling that your actions are important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competence - feeling that you are good at what you are doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relatedness - feeling connection to other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a great work requires creativity, impact and control. 
Jobs with these features are rare and valuable. As a result, due to supply &amp;amp; demand
you have to provide something rare and valuable in return (e.g. good skills).
The author calls such skills “career capital”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mindsets-passion-vs-craftsmanship&quot;&gt;Mindsets: passion vs craftsmanship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to passion mindset (focusing on what a job offers you), there is craftsmanship mindset
(focusing on what you produce).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the passion mindset - answering “do I really love this?” and “what do I like?” is nearly impossible and leads to unhappiness.
Also this forces you to focus on what you don’t like, but all entry level jobs are not perfect (low autonomy and few challenges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion mindset claims that you need only courage to start your dream job, which will have creativity, impact and autonomy.
Craftsmanship mindset requires you to build your skills first (“to be come so good they can’t ignore you”) to earn
creativity, impact and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some jobs are just not good for craftsmanship mindset. The job is like that if it has any of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one cannot build skill in it to distinguish themselves from others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one finds the results they produce useless or even harmful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one is forced to work with people they don’t like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deliberate-practice&quot;&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are some guitar players not that good, while others are much better even after the same amount of practice?
They’ve practiced differently. If you don’t get out of your comfort level during practice, you won’t develop your
skill that well. Instead you should do deliberate practice - focus on what you do badly and use immediate feedback
to correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps to do deliberate practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the career capital market you are in - winner-takes-all or an auction
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Winner-takes-all - only one skill matters and everyone competes for it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Auction - many skills are important, everyone can propose a combination of skills.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify which career capital you need to pursue (i.e. which skill or skills).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define “good”, i.e. your feedback criteria and clear goals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Stretch”. Practice outside of your comfort zone and accept feedback even if it
disagrees with your feelings. You may think that what you did is perfect, but you may
be not the one deciding in the end and then your opinion won’t matter at all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be patient - improving takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use open gates - some opportunities which you happened to have e.g. by chance - to gain
career capital much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaining-control-at-work&quot;&gt;Gaining control at work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving people control over what and how they do increases their happiness, satisfactions and
fulfillment. Once you have career capital you can use it to gain control in your work.
Gaining control before you have enough career capital is dangerous. I.e. you can start doing
what you really want, but no one will find it valuable (e.g. a startup, which no one finds
interesting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have enough career capital to pursue more control (i.e. become valuable enough),
your current employer will try to prevent you from gaining this control, because
this has negative impact for them (less control of you, possibility to lose you). They would
rather use your career capital further and on the old terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, courage is important to face this resistance. However, you should be valuable enough as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-law-of-financial-viability&quot;&gt;The Law of Financial Viability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to identify whether you have enough career capital to go for more control?
If you have an idea how to gain more control, seek evidence whether people are willing to pay you
for it. If yes, proceed. Otherwise move on.
“Willing to pay” may have different meaning, e.g. they actually pay you or you get a loan or you get hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Do what people are willing to pay for” Derek Sivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless people are ready to pay you for an idea, it is not an idea you should go after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mission&quot;&gt;Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building career on some mission can make it more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Adjacent possible” - a set of discoveries that are possible to make from the current state of science.
E.g. discovering oxygen required precise weight scales and thinking about air as something not void.
These 2 inventions moved “oxygen discovery” into “adjacent possible”. This concept is considered 
in greater detail in “Where Good Ideas Come From” by Steven Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore “adjacent possible” one has to reach the cutting edge. Finding a career mission is like
a scientific breakthrough. Reaching the cutting edge is equivalent to building career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going for one large bold idea, one should do small incremental “little bets”, which will
mostly fail and only sometimes succeed. This way one can gather feedback. Each bet should take 
approximately 2 months and be either successful or fail. Each bet should follow your mission idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career capital helps to identify a good mission, little bets help to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;law-of-remarkability&quot;&gt;Law of remarkability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission driven projects need to be remarkable. People who encounter them should want to
“remark” about it, i.e. share. Projects should also be launched in a venue which 
supports such remarks (i.e. allows and promotes sharing). “Purple Cow” by Seth Godin
talks about this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="book" /><category term="summary" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">I’ve read “So Good They Can’t Ignore You” by Cal Newport.

of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being&quot;&gt;&quot;The science of wellbeing&quot;&lt;/a&gt; course at Coursera happened to be much larger than
I originally expected. Here is a more concise one, so that one can quickly refresh all important details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;important-warning-disclaimer&quot;&gt;Important-warning-disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is my very brief summary of the course. If you are considering taking the course,
don’t read this summary. This will spoil all the fun for you. Just go ahead and do the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t consider taking the course, please think again. It is really an amazing course and both of my
summaries probably miss a lot of details. You will get much more by going through the course
(it is only ~19 hours) and doing all the revirements and seeing all the research. Please do the course,
you will like it and understand what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summary is also too brief to make sense on its own. This is rather a cheat-sheet for people who
took the entire course. Taking the course (or at least reading 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;my larger summary&lt;/a&gt;)
would explain a lot of the items below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now let’s get started with a brief summary. Reading through everything in 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;my “large” summary&lt;/a&gt;
is possible, but takes a lot of time. Thus, I would like to summarize my summary even more and write
something short, which I could quickly reread when I feel like I started to forget the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-are-wrong&quot;&gt;We are wrong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that having a good job, high salary, money, awesome stuff, true love, a perfect face/body or good grades will make us happy.
Actually we miswant these (i.e. are mistaken about how much we will like something in the future),
because of annoying features of our minds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our mind strongest intuitions are often totally wrong&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We judge everything relative to (often irrelevant) reference points (e.g. other people or what we had before)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hedonic adaptation - our minds are built to get used to stuff (both positive and negative)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We don’t know about this adaptation and overestimate effects of negative and positive changes in our lives
(due to focalism and immune neglect). You will be fine if you fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prefer (non-material) experiences to physical stuff.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Anticipate them&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talk about them with others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Savour - step outside of an experience to review and appreciate it fully while it is still happening.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Laugh, giggle, express energy physically (jumping, yelling)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Think how lucky and proud you are&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Don’t &lt;del&gt;think about future&lt;/del&gt;, don’t &lt;del&gt;remind yourself that experience will be over or could be better or
 will never be so good again&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Express gratitude
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tell other people if you are grateful to them&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once a week write 5 items from the last week, which you are grateful for (take time to feel it through)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reset your reference points
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After a positive change, re-experience your previous state (either remember or find a real example)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Curate information which you let into your life (e.g. no social media, no TV)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Interrupt your consumption - split awesome things you love (and vice versa - squish all bad things together to use 
 hedonic adaptation)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Increase variety and choose proper timing (don’t eat an ice cream 40 seconds after the previous one)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want right things
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Employing signature strengths in your career&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Getting into “flow” both at work and at leisure&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Growth mindset (“I can grow through hard work”) instead of fixed (&lt;del&gt;“talent is fixed”&lt;/del&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Intrinsic motivation (doing something due to enjoying the activity itself) instead of extrinsic (due to external rewards)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opportunities to do acts of kindness (even small, even to random people)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Social connections (even talking to strangers)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Time affluence (feeling of having enough time to do things you actually want)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Controlling your mind (i.e. decreasing mind-wandering through meditation)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enough sleep (and of good quality)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-implement&quot;&gt;How to implement?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just knowing is not sufficient. Strategies for better habits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Situation support (fix bad environments, promote healthy environments)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set specific goals (e.g. quantitative). Specificity gives you a plan how to achieve the goal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visualize goals: positive outcome followed by possible obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation intention through “if then” plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3 can be combined into WOOP method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about your (optionally the most important for now) wish (as specific as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Its best outcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potential obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your if/then plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This links the obstacle to the wish together with instruments to overcome it and helps to recognize existence of the obstacle&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><category term="summary" /><summary type="html">My summary of &quot;The science of wellbeing&quot; course at Coursera happened to be much larger than I originally expected.

Lectures 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-of-previous-lectures&quot;&gt;Summary of previous lectures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-4-molecular-genetics-i&quot;&gt;Lecture 4: Molecular genetics I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dna&quot;&gt;DNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is a sequence of amino acids.
DNA encodes amino acid.
A sequence of DNA can encode sequence of amino acids, i.e. a protein.
Actually genes (DNA) specify the intermediate form - RNA.
Sequence of genes defines everything else - DNA, RNA, amino acids, protein and its shape.
Protein function is defined by its shape (analogy - protein reception is a lock and protein is its key).
There are 20 amino acids. All of them have different degrees of being attracted or repelled by water.
This relationship with watter defines which shape a string of amino acids (i.e. protein) will have in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enzymes catalyze reactions. For our purposes they can take 2 things and stick them together or take one thing and break it
apart. Virtually every enzyme is a protein. Protein structure also defines circumstances when
its shape can change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central dogma of life (information flow): &lt;del&gt;DNA -&amp;gt; RNA -&amp;gt; protein&lt;/del&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterexamples to the first claim that everything starts with DNA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;viruses which hijack DNA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RNA viruses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;enzymes which can convert RNA back to DNA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mutations&quot;&gt;Mutations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micromutation - one letter random change in DNA.
Each amino acid is encoded by 3 base pairs (a triplet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single letter mutations can be categorized by their effect as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no effect. There are 4^3 = 64 ways to encode amino acids and only 20 amino acids. The genetic code is redundant.
Thus, the letter change can have no effect on resulting sequence of amino acids. Usually, the middle base pair in amino acid is
less important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;weak effect. Some mutations can change resulting amino acid, but some amino acids are similar, so this may not
change the shape of the protein much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;major consequences. Some mutations can change the protein function dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to single letter mutation, there are single point mutations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deletion. This creates a frame shift and totally changes entire sequence of amino acids.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;insertion (e.g. accidental copy). This makes a frame shift in other direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutations change how well a protein does its job (i.e. its efficacy) by changing its shape.
Soma changes are minor, i.e. the protein mostly does it function, but a little bit less efficiently
(i.e. the key still fits the lock, but not ideally anymore). This is a microevolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some changes can be major like knocking the protein completely out of its old business,
which can have dramatic effects overall, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is a chemical called phenylalanine, which can cause harm if there is too much of it.
There is an enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase which converts it into something safer, if this enzyme malfunctions,
this can have extreme effects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria&quot;&gt;Phenylketonuria disorder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;testicular feminization syndrome (male looks like completely healthy but infertile female)
caused by mutation in testosterone receptor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;problems with enzymes producing testosterone. 
Mutation changes testosterone production efficiency.
There is not enough testosterone in the childhood and the individual develops as female.
During puberty the level reaches critical threshold and one changes sex.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mutation can change how benzodiazepines interact with their receptors.
This variability explains individual differences in levels of anxiety.
For example, people are breading rats prone to some behavior - alcoholism, smart, high or low anxiety.
The last two breeds differ by shape of their benzodiazepine receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foxp2 gene is related to communication. Its mutation can cause language problems in humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-dna-is-compared&quot;&gt;How DNA is compared&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you share 50% of DNA with your sibling, but 98% with chimpanzee? Genes specify traits.
E.g. we have genes for specific shape of pelvis. Chimps have them too,
but apple trees don’t. 98% of our and chimp genes encode similar traits (like some shape of pelvis).
Each gene can vary. Thus, when talking about your sibling, the question is not
whether you both have genes for pelvis, but whether they are exactly the same (i.e. same shape of pelvis).
Overall, when we compare across species, we take into account only types of genes encoding
types of traits. Inside one species - different versions of a particular gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gradualism-vs-punctuated-equilibrium&quot;&gt;Gradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 1980s everyone believed in gradualism, 
i.e. that &lt;del&gt;evolution was driven by gradual changes&lt;/del&gt;.
In 1980s a new model called “punctuated equilibrium” emerged. Here periods of stasis (no change) are followed
by very fast and explosive periods of change. It was proposed by a paleontologist.
Consequence of this theory - little changes don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paleontology is different from evolutionary biology.
The timescales are very different (100k years is nothing in paleontology and a lot in biology).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolution of brain, eye color, skin will leave no paleontological record.
Paleontology is about shapes (morphology).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980s non-gradualists (supporters of punctuated equilibrium) struggled to show molecular mechanisms
which could explain punctuated equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dna-structure&quot;&gt;DNA structure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially people thought that DNA had the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;gene A&amp;gt;&amp;lt;stop signal&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene B&amp;gt;&amp;lt;stop signal&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene C&amp;gt;...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually genes themselves have modular structure as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;       exon        intron          exon
&amp;lt;gene A - part 1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene A - part 2&amp;gt;...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splicing enzymes cut out unrelated parts.
What if a function of a splicing enzyme changes?
If we have a gene with 3 exons (denote them 1, 2, 3), after splicing and gluing back we can get - 123, 12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3
(i.e. 7 different proteins out of one gene). This allows tissue specific expression of genes.
Same gene will produce different types of proteins in different parts of the body due to different splicing enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are splicing enzymes which can cut inside exons (not in-between). 
I.e. in the example above, after slicing one can get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;some part of &quot;gene A - part 1&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene A - part 2&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, even more proteins can be created from one gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another discovery - there is non-coding DNA between genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;       gene A    &amp;gt;  non coding DNA   &amp;lt;      gene B     &amp;gt;
&amp;lt;A1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A2&amp;gt;-------------------&amp;lt;B1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;B2&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;95% of all DNA is non-coding.
Non-coding DNA is an instruction booklet when to activate which genes (i.e. on/off switches).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are proteins (transcription factors) which turn these switches on/off (i.e.
promote or repress some sequences of genes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same promoter can enable more than one gene (i.e. networks of genes). Any gene can 
have multiple different switches (i.e. can belong to different networks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, DNA does not “know” what it is doing, it is just a readout. The one in control is the one
controlling transcription factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, environment can affect genes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in cells there are sensors which activate some transcription factors when energy level is low&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gene expression in the cell can be regulated by environment somewhere else in the body (e.g.
through hormones - testosterone causes your muscles to grow)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or even outside of the body (pheromones).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNA itself is wrapped in chromatin, which opens up for transcription factors.
I.e. it can regulate which transcription factors can reach DNA at all.
Parts of chromatin can be even permanently closed to silence a specific gene forever.
Epigenetics studies regulation of access to gene sequences.
For example, in rats the way mother behaves can affect stress hormones of her kids permanently
through this mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the most interesting part of DNA is not shape of proteins, but when it is active
(i.e. DNA has if-then clauses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetics is about fertilization, epigenetics is about development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-5-molecular-genetics-ii&quot;&gt;Lecture 5: Molecular genetics II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mutation in a splicing factor can cause very dramatic changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;A1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A3&amp;gt;
can become
A1|A2' + A2''|A3
instead of
A1|A2|A3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get a mutation in a promoter. This changes the activated gene network (i.e. completely new
if-then clause). In other words, there are amplifying effects of small changes when they happen in splicing factors or promoters.
In vols one promoter change defines whether they are monogamous or polygamous.
A large share of differences between us and chimps are changes in transcription factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, evolutionary changes are mostly driven by regulatory changes in DNA, not in protein encoding itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dna-shuffling&quot;&gt;DNA shuffling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants can’t run away, so they have tricks to shuffle their DNA as a response to a stressor.
Immune system in animals does this shuffling too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shuffle DNA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate antibodies based on obtained DNA sequences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See whether they work against the pathogen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathogens can do the same to fight antibodies. This is a coevolutionary arm race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process also happens when your neurons are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By moving parts of DNA around you can have large macro consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing “if dehydrated, then wake up kidneys” to “if dehydrated, then also ovulate” 
allows seasonal mating. Mate during dry season to give birth during raining season.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“if smells like me, then don’t mate (incest taboo)” -&amp;gt; “if smells like me, cooperate”
creates kin selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such shuffling allows to introduce variability in degrees of an effect as well
(e.g. if smells very much like me - cooperate very much, a little bit like me - cooperate a bit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have clauses “if &lt;some hormone=&quot;&quot;&gt;, then&quot;. These can be shuffled as well.
E.g. glucocorticoids suppress immune system. If you swap it with progesterone,
then this is useful during pregnancy (no immune system response to fetus).
But immune system can overshoot after pregnancy and this leads to autoimmune diseases.
I.e. one &quot;small&quot; change (which hormone) has large macro consequences.&lt;/some&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One single base pair change can cause diseases, which will kill at 3 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, such macro changes have negative effect. It is just unlikely to stumble on something
positive. Thus, there is stabilizing selection against macro mutational changes, i.e. long periods of stasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;speed-of-evolutionary-changes&quot;&gt;Speed of evolutionary changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution has selective bottlenecks - events through which only individuals with some trait can get through.
Cheetahs has got through one and now they are highly inbreed (you can transplant tissue from one to another
and it won’t be rejected).
Such bottlenecks create circumstances of punctuated radical change. This “rapid” change can still take
thousands of generations (which is a lot for biologists and not that much for paleontologists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macro mutational changes - invention of new proteins and networks.
Micro mutational changes - changes in function of preexisting proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. immune systems in chimps and humans differ only through micro changes,
while development - macro differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of “fast” changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westernized diet causes diabetes. Populations which get introduced to western diets
get a very high rate of diabetes. With time the most vulnerable don’t pass their genes and
rate of diabetes starts to go down (evolution of resistance). This happened within a century.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Siberian foxes have been bred for only 35 generations for tameness
(calmness around people). They started looking like cute puppies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/5_fox_ears_like_puppy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fox looking like puppy&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first domesticated fox to have floppy ears, 1969 (source: “The silver fox domestication experiment” Dugatkin, 2018, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-018-0090-x&quot;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/5_fox_facial_characters_like_puppy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fox face looking like puppy&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domesticated foxes have juvenile facial features, including shorter snout (source: “The silver fox domestication experiment” Dugatkin, 2018, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-018-0090-x&quot;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In other words, they’ve got dog-like traits - e.g. wagging their tails around people.
  Actually breeding for tameness is equivalent to breeding for acting like a child and
  infantile traits (being dependent on others).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Their fur changed too. Ironically in the process of breeding they became useless economically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is antibiotic resistance. Bacterias can develop resistance to our drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, traits evolve as groups. Thus, there are many punctuated changes at the same time.
If you have enough of them, this will look like gradual change (gradualism).
In some sense both models (gradualism and punctuated equilibrium) are correct at the same.
Punctuated equilibrium is observed on individual trait level and gradualism when considering
multiple traits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Continuing writing a summary for Robert Sapolsky’s course “Human Behavioral Biology”.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are sure that you will buy something and there happens to be a discount for it,
you save money by buying with the discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expiration-date-discounts&quot;&gt;“Expiration date” discounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with discounts motivated by a product reaching its expiration date.
Basically all products have some expiration date. After that date supermarkets
can’t sell the product anymore, i.e. they lose the money used to buy the product in the first place.
Thus, they are motivated to incentivize people to buy the product before the expiration date. 
When there is not much time left, they create this incentive by adding a discount.
Usually in German supermarkets it is 30% off and usually it is added 1-2 days before
the expiration date, but occasionally this can happen even 1 week in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, this is a way to save 30% on some of your food. This mostly works for food
with shorter storage time like meat and bread (but not e.g. canned food).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this safe? Yes, the food hasn’t actually expired yet.
I also suspect that food producers actually have some safety margin
in the expiration date. In other words they may set the expiration date much earlier to be extremely sure that the
product won’t go bad before that time. This is just my speculation though. Overall, I am not aware of any safety issues
with this approach. Obviously, you should inspect food you buy using all your senses and trust your self preservation
mechanisms, but this applies to anything you consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we can’t just store such food in the fridge for long. One example usage is to cook it soonish.
Usually once you cook it, you can store it for a bit longer or you can just consume the cooked food immediately.
To save even more, you can freeze such foods (this works especially well for meat).
This way you can store it for couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discounts are more frequent on Saturdays. I suspect this is because the shops are closed on Sundays, so on Saturday they have to sell
all food which would otherwise go bad on Sunday and Monday. This works even better before large holidays (e.g. Christmas)
presumably for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weekly-discounts&quot;&gt;Weekly discounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the second kind of discounts. Almost all popular shops in Germany have “random” discounts which change each week. 
This time they are not related to the expiration date (i.e. there is nothing unusual about the products).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-to-explain-this&quot;&gt;Ways to explain this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of hypotheses why supermarkets do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This brings people to the supermarket itself.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once a person is there, they can lose their self control and buy more stuff (even non-discounted).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The time spent getting to the shop can be considered as a sunk cost and promote buying more as well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discount itself may promote buying more of the discounted product, i.e. “I don’t actually need this,
but next week there will be no discount, so I should buy it now to get the discount”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storing stuff presumably costs money. Occasionally it may be better to sell stuff with a discount than to store it. I.e. the shop may
“pass” you some portion of the money they would otherwise pay for storage, but which they managed to save by you buying the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-to-discover&quot;&gt;Ways to discover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 major ways to discover such discounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the shop itself and look for brightly colored price tags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check shop’s magazines online (the German keyword is “Prospekt”,
e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lidl.de/de/online-prospekt&quot;&gt;Lidl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penny.de/angebote/prospekt-der-woche/&quot;&gt;Penny&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netto-online.de/ueber-netto/Online-Prospekte.chtm&quot;&gt;Netto&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely prefer the second approach, since it is much more efficient (takes less time and you don’t look
at non-discounted products at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-pitfalls&quot;&gt;Possible pitfalls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should keep in mind that supermarkets are doing this for a long time and, thus, in the end this must be
profitable for them. As a result you should be careful and make sure that you are actually the one
benefiting from these discounts. I can imagine the following possible pitfalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you able to control yourself at the shop itself and stick to buying only what you originally planned?
Lists help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t need something in the first place, you just lose money by buying it (even when it is heavily discounted).
E.g. you never eat rice, there is no point in buying it, even when it costs 50% less this week. Instead you should focus on things you
would buy anyway. However, if your uncle loves rice and consumes 3 kilograms of it during his visits, buying rice with 50% discount
and storing it saves you money.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There is a neat way in which you can check the magazines to avoid this issue - look only at the
product pictures (but not prices) at first. I.e. if you don’t need something, don’t even check its price. Once you find
something you need, check its price.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discount on a more expensive product may be not a discount for you.
E.g. you use shampoo A, which costs 1 euro per liter, but there is a discounted shampoo B which costs only 2 euro per liter
instead of its normal price of 4 euro. If you buy B, you actually lose 1 euro (i.e. discounted B price minus normal A price) instead of
saving 2 euro as it might have looked at first.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another variation of this is seasonal food price fluctuations. E.g. in winter watermelons can have a discounted price of 
 only 0.99 per kilo instead of 1.99. However, they cost 0.4 per kilo during the season. So you still in some sense lose
 money when paying discounted 0.99. Obviously, if you consume watermelons all year round, you would actually save, so go for it!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another example could be if a shop increases the price right before having a discount. 
 I don’t think this is intentionally done in Germany, but still worth keeping in mind especially in other countries.
 Usually you start remembering normal prices for main staples with time. Alternatively, if you track your expenses 
 in great detail, you could use that info to double check the price (e.g. how much did this cost last time I bought it?).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different offers in magazines can apply to different dates. Yes, they like to have 5 pages with entire week discounts, 
followed by one page for only e.g. Mon-Wed discounts. I think this is intended, because then people may miss this and
when they buy a lot of stuff in addition to discounted things (but you shouldn’t do this anyway), they will miss that
they are buying without the discount. However, if you don’t buy much, just check the receipt after buying. Normally, there is a paper
magazine in the shop itself, so you can double check the discounted price there (or even show it to the cashier).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There may be no discounted price tags on Monday yet. I’ve got an impression that discounted price tags appear after some time.
So if you go on Monday morning, either take the paper magazine or note down the prices you expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-can-i-save&quot;&gt;How much can I save?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends on you and how flexible you are. For example, Jacob from &lt;a href=&quot;http://earlyretirementextreme.com/&quot;&gt;Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/a&gt; suggests to buy &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; discounted food and then decide what to cook out of it. This definitely requires quite some creativity
and may be not that convenient. Alternatively you can go for some middle ground solution. For example, one can buy discounted food
which can be stored for a long time. This mostly includes canned and frozen foods (already frozen vegetables/fruits or self frozen meat).
Canned foods can be easily stored 1-2 years, so it is possible to buy reasonably large discounted batches and just store it and use
whenever there is a need. Already frozen foods also have large lifespan, you just need a freezer and a reliable energy source.
For self frozen there is no clear time bound, but its state may start to become worse after e.g. 3 months, so that’s a good rule of thumb
I use. This way you still have flexibility (you can cook what you want right now), while partially benefiting from discounts available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observed 10-30% discounts, so if you manage to buy 100 euro of discounted food, you would save 10-30 euro. 
While this is not a life changing sum of money and you definitely shouldn’t rely on this discount in your
FIRE calculations (otherwise the calculations are too tight, trust me), it is also not that much of an effort and can be
even pleasant if you like optimizing your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may think here that this is not worth their time, because they earn so much more than that.
I’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;/post/my-time-costs-x-fallacy&quot;&gt;looked into this (“My time costs X” fallacy)&lt;/a&gt;.
In this particular case you can check the magazines literally in 5-10 minutes and you would have to go the shop anyway
(unless you order your food online, but then you have more fruitful ways to save money, for example, by not ordering
food online).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy discounted shopping!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="saving" /><summary type="html">I recently started buying discounted food more and here are my tips &amp;amp; tricks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“The science of wellbeing” - my impression and summary</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;The science of wellbeing&quot; - my impression and summary" /><published>2019-03-19T19:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-03-19T19:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/the_science_of_wellbeing_course_review</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review">&lt;p&gt;I took &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being&quot;&gt;&quot;The science of wellbeing&quot;&lt;/a&gt; course at Coursera.
I absolutely loved it! I would like to share my impression and a not so brief summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this course accidentally, when I was doing much more popular “Learning how to learn” course.
As I’ve already said in &lt;a href=&quot;/post/learning-how-to-learn-course-review&quot;&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt; of “Learning how to learn”, 
my impression was pretty mixed, but I learned a couple things. “The science of wellbeing” was just amazing and it is surprisingly
much less popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have no idea what could have been done better. The course consists of 10 weeks, the last 4 have very little material
and meant for the last large “revirement”. The first 5 weeks or so had weekly “revirements”. A revirement is some task,
which you should do during the week and which is meant to boost your wellbeing. So you do the revirements and in parallel 
learn about happiness and wellbeing and after some time learn the science behind each of the revirements as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies were mentioned perfectly. Basically, the teacher makes some claim and then briefly explains results of
2-3 studies supporting this claim. Many of the studies were mind-blowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t recommend it &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;. It easily can be a life-changing course.
You should take this course, everyone should take this course.
Your mind will be blown away by how wrong we are, when we think about happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 5/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;important-warning-disclaimer&quot;&gt;Important-warning-disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is my summary of the course. If you are considering taking the course,
don’t read the summary. This will spoil all the fun for you. Just go ahead and do the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t consider taking the course, please think again. It is really an amazing course and my
summary probably misses a lot of details. You will get much more by going through the course
(it is only ~19 hours) and doing all the revirements and seeing all the research. Please do the course,
you will like it and understand what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I assume that you don’t take the course (but you should) or you are just me rereading the summary
after some time to refresh all the fruitful bits I’ve forgotten. So let’s get started with the summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note I’ve restructured the order of the topics a bit to make the text more coherent. In the real course there was
one week delay between lectures, so giving a hint about the next week topic worked well, but here this feels weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-think-will-make-us-happy&quot;&gt;What we think will make us happy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a pretty good picture of what should make us happy.
However, will it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider each popular option. Later we will look why they actually won’t make us happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;good-job&quot;&gt;Good job&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does not getting a job makes us unhappy [Gilbert 1998]?
When people get refused and consider it fair, they predict 2/10 happiness score drop, but actually it is 0.6/10.
When they consider it unfair - 1.9/10 predicted vs 0/10 actual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-salary&quot;&gt;High salary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much salary do you need (based on how much you have now) [Lyubomirsky 2008]?
If your current salary is 30k, you need 50k, but if it is 100k, you need 250k.
E.g. you target jumps up with each salary increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;money&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random interesting fact: US lottery ticket spending in 2015 was 70B, which is larger than books, music, movie tickets, sport tickets and video games combined. This could mean that people assume that having a lot of money will make them happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlation between “life satisfaction” and income is 0.1 - 0.15. In poor countries it is stronger, because increasing the income gets you access to clean water, basic health-care. Once your basic needs are met, increase in money has negligible effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does general quality of life increase happiness? In 1940 average happiness was 7.5/10 and in 2015 it is 7.2/10. Living in 1940 was much harder (e.g. no washing machines).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US happiness stops increasing after $75k [Kahneman]. However, our own evaluation of life increases even after 75k.
In other words, high income does not bring you happiness, but does bring a life that you think is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall money do make us happier a little bit, but way less than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;awesome-stuff&quot;&gt;Awesome stuff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If only I had &lt;em&gt;__&lt;/em&gt; I would be so happy”.
Nope, you wouldn’t and actively seeking it can even make you less happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;true-love&quot;&gt;True love&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Married people are happier in the first 2 years and then there is no difference to non-married.
True love makes us happier only for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;having-a-perfect-facebody&quot;&gt;Having a perfect face/body&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who complete a weight lose program end up with increased depression rate.
Similarly for cosmetic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-good-grades&quot;&gt;Getting good grades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not as much as you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-it-doesnt-make-us-happy&quot;&gt;Why it doesn’t make us happy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is considered in more details in “The how of happiness” by Sonja Lyubomirsky.
Her research shows that genes and circumstances are less important for happiness than we think.
Their contributions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;genetic - 50%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;circumstances (life happens) - 10%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actions / thoughts - 40% (this we can control)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are things we can do to be happier, but most of the things we are trying to achieve to increase our happiness
won’t make us happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can think that this is true for others, but you are different. However, all the research suggests otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miswanting - the act of being mistaken about what and how much you will like something in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we miswant? Because of annoying features of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feature-1-wrong-intuitions&quot;&gt;Feature 1: Wrong intuitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mind’s strongest intuitions are often totally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feature-2-reference-points&quot;&gt;Feature 2: Reference points&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t think in terms of absolutes. Instead we judge relative to reference points.
A reference point - a salient (but often irrelevant) standard against which all subsequent information
is compared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: [Medvec et al 1995] at Olympics the silver winner thinks “I could have had gold” and feels unhappy,
while bronze medalist thinks “Oh, I could have had no medal at all” and feels happy. They have different reference points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of reference points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We. E.g. our previous salary. Our idea of “good income” goes up with our current income. 
Each 1$ increase increases our target by 1.4$ [Van Praat &amp;amp; Fritjers 1999].&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others (social comparison). E.g. if your coworkers have higher salary, you are less happy with your job. 
This can take very weird forms. When asked to choose between “you make 50k, others 25k” and “you - 100k, others - 250k”, 56%
have chosen the former [Solnick &amp;amp; Henenway 1998], even though it is half as much money. Unemployed people
have higher wellbeing [Clark 2003] when unemployment rate is high.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thus, getting extreme social reference points makes you unhappy. 
E.g. [O’Guinn &amp;amp; Schrum 1997] the more people watch TV, the higher they estimate wealth of other people around them (not on TV)
and the lower - their own wealth. The more you watch TV, the more unhappy you become with yourself, because you implicitly 
compare yourself with what you see.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We just try to keep up with whoever happens to be around. We don’t even try to find reasonable reference points.
E.g. [Kuhn et al 2011] when someone wins a car in a lottery, their neighbors are then more likely to buy a car as well.
[Kenrick et al 1993] Just looking at pictures of fashion models lowers women mood from 2.36/4 to 2.07/4.
This can affect perception of your partner. [Kenrick et all 1989] Men rated attractiveness of their partner 
lower after looking at models (22.1 vs 26.2 in control).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For the new generation this is even worse due to social media.
Correlation between Facebook use &amp;amp; self esteem is -0.2 [Vogel et al 2014].
Looking at people who are doing worse then you have no effect on your self esteem though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feature-3-adaptation&quot;&gt;Feature 3: Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our minds are built to get used to stuff. Hedonic adaptation - the process of becoming accustomed to a positive or negative
stimulus such that the emotional effects of that stimulus are attenuated (weakened) over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful things are especially wonderful the first time they happen, but their wonderfulness fades with repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feature-4-we-dont-know-about-adaptation&quot;&gt;Feature 4: We don’t know about adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t realize that our minds are built to get used to stuff.
This works both ways - feeling better about bad stuff as well as feeling worse about good stuff due to getting used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact bias - the tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of a future event both in terms of intensity and its duration.
It is worse for negative effects - at first we feel like “this is going to destroy our life”. 
For positive - the event ends up being just not as awesome as we predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works even in very surprising situations. [Sieff 1999] People predict their happiness score to be 47.4 the moment they find out that
they have HIV, but their actual score is 59.1. For the case when the test result says “no HIV”, they predict 94.7, but in reality it
is 77.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we just have not enough experience, because the events are rare? Nope.
[Ayton 2007] When failing driver exam multiple times, every time you fail you still overestimate how bad 
you will feel if you fail next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be explained with two psychological biases (this is considered more deeply in “Stumbling on Happiness” book):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focalism - tendency to think just about one event and forget about other things that happen. When you focus on one thing,
you misspredict. Try to think about stuff around the event. E.g. when thinking about illness, people forget that the 
majority of good things they had in their life won’t go away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immune neglect - unawareness of our “psychological immune system”, i.e. of the tendency to adapt to and cope with
negative events. Our brains have a lot of resilience to deal with bad things. You have mechanisms to force yourself 
to feel better and you use them more than you realize. E.g. we can rationalize everything (“this bad event was actually good
for me because …”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible result of these biases is the new generation being scared to take risks. You will be fine if you fail.
You misspredict your own potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-to-do&quot;&gt;So what to do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strategies which allow you to boost your happiness. They fix our current miswantings (by helping us to
want right things) and help us to want other unexpected things which actually make us happier, but which we would never
want on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;awesome-stuff-1&quot;&gt;Awesome stuff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t invest in physical stuff in the first place. It won’t make you as happy as you think, because it sticks around and you get
used to it.
Quote by Gilbert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Part of us believes the new car is better because it lasts longer. But in fact that’s the worst thing about the new car… It will stay around to disappoint you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead invest in experiences - they don’t stick around. Experience - anything you can pay for (or free) that makes you happy 
but is not a physical thing. You just won’t have time to adapt to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Van Boven &amp;amp; Gilovich 2003] People find that experiences bring happy thoughts (7.51 vs 6.62 for material), contribute to happiness (6.4 vs 5.42) and they consider money spent on experiences spent better (7.3 vs 6.42). This effect gets stronger the larger income
you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about the experience in advance (anticipation), this makes you happier as well.
You feel more excited and better about planned experience purchase vs material (2.64 vs 1.37, 2.58 vs 1.06 respectively) [Kumar et al 2014].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People’s intuition is wrong about this. They predict that material purchase will make them happier than experiential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about your experiences makes you happier as well. This can just be more interesting for others to hear or help
them to resonate with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiences are less susceptible to social comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about things we already have (including marriage, being at Yell [note: this is a Yell course])?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savoring.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use savoring, i.e. stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it fully while it still happens.
This forces you to notice and enjoy the experience and keep your attention on it.
This also helps you to focus on the experience for even longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Jose et al 2012] Activities to enhance savoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to another person about how good you felt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for other people to share the experience with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about what a lucky person you are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about sharing (talking) this later with others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show physical expression of energy (jumping around from joy, yelling)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laugh or giggle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell yourself how proud you are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think only about the present and be absorbed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities which hurt savoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on the future (i.e. think about experience being over)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reminding yourself that the experience will be over soon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reminding yourself that nothing lasts forever&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking how it will never be this good again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking about ways it could be better [note: I definitely unknowingly experienced this myself]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Telling yourself that you don’t deserve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Kurtz 2008] Taking photos is controversial in terms of savoring.
You can take photos in two ways:
1) Focusing on photos themselves and not being mindful (i.e. photos is the goal)
2) Using your photos to see different aspects of the thing you taking picture of,
learning about new and better properties of it (i.e. as a tool for savoring)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One actionable way to do savoring is [Lyubomirsky et al (2006)] to think about a happy event “as though
you are rewinding a videotape and playing it back” (8 min/day * 3 days). People had sustained increases
in positive emotions 4 weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way is negative visualization - thinking about the reverse that could have happened.
[Koo et al 2008] E.g. couples wrote for 15 minutes about how they might have never met their partner (or about how they met).
In the first case happiness score was 5.67, latter - 4.77.
This helps you to break yourself out of here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frame your view as “the experience may be over soon” instead of “I have plenty of time left”.
This way you focus on how it would be without the thing you have and this brings you out of
hedonic adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, advantages of savoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fights hedonic adaptation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keeps us in the moment (without mind wandering)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases gratitude (we become thankful for the experience during the experience itself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use gratitude. Gratitude - the quality of being thankful and a tendency to show appreciation
for what one has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Emmons &amp;amp; Mc Cullough 2010] Writing once a week 5 things from last week, which you are grateful for, boosts your happiness,
decreases physical symptoms and increases hours of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing gratitude can be extra powerful. Tell other people if you are grateful to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gratitude can help in romantic relationships (e.g. to mitigate bad things in a relationship).
In work context, receiving gratitude from your superior makes you work 50% harder (without additional pay) [Grand &amp;amp; Gino 2010].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, feeling gratitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases mood, lowers stress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improves health&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creates stronger social connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reset-your-reference-points&quot;&gt;Reset your reference points&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They affect our happiness judgments all the time (even if we don’t realize it).
E.g. potato chips taste better when they are placed near sardines than when near chocolate [Morewedge et al 2010].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concretely re-experience. The moment you get something (e.g. a dream job) it becomes your new reference point.
Find a way to go back to your previous state and re-experience it. Make a habit to go back and re-experience
the stuff as it was before your current state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concretely observe. Find a real example of a worse situation (e.g. similar to what you had before) and look at it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid social comparisons.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stop technique. The moment you notice you are doing social comparisons (browsing Instagram), say “stop” out loud&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gratitude stops social comparison (“gratitude is killer of envy”)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be conscious of the kinds of social comparisons you are letting in your life. Curate your own info. 
E.g. “Real Beauty” campaign instead of “Victoria Secret” models.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No social media. Otherwise be mindful when using them and use techniques above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interrupt your consumption. If you force yourself to have an interruption, you set your reference in a very positive way
(absence of the thing). [Nelson &amp;amp; Meyvis 2008] When making people listen to their favorite music with a pause inside the song,
people’s happiness jumps dramatically right after the pause. [Neolson et all 2009] Commercials on TV make you enjoy the thing
you are watching more. Thus, split the awesome things you love in life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For bad things, you want hedonic adaptation to kick in quickly. Thus, don’t break them up. Try to squish all of them together 
instead. E.g. do a hard problem at once instead of 15 minute chunks with breaks in between.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase your variety.
If you always eat the same ice cream (A A A A A…) you will adapt and it will get boring.
If you eat different ones and then get back to the one you tried first (A B C D A), it will feel cool again.
This breaks your adaptation and changes your reference point. Timing also matters. Eating an ice cream 40 seconds after
the previous one is boring. Variety is another reason why experiences are better for your happiness than material stuff.
Experiences are dynamic, while stuff is constant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;want-right-things&quot;&gt;Want right things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we should want to become happier, but don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good job.&lt;/strong&gt; We want high salary. Instead we should seek a career that employs our signature strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signature strengths - character strengths that are the most essential to who we are.
Character strength properties:
1) Ubiquitous (widely recognized across cultures)
2) Fulfilling (leads to satisfaction and fulfillment)
3) Morally-valued
4) Not able to diminish others
5) The opposite of a negative trait
6) Trait-like (stable individual difference)
7) Measurable
8) Distinctive (not redundant with other strengths)
9) Paragons (some people really have it and it is very strong)
10) Prodigies (some people precociously (from birth) have it)
11) Selective absence (some people don’t have it)
12) Institutionalized (society values it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 24 character strengths overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Seligman et al 2005] Using your top strengths in new and different ways every day for a week improves happiness and
decreases depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Lavy &amp;amp; Littran-Ovadia 2016] The more you use your strengths at work, the more productive and more satisfied with your job
you become (caused by positive emotions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Harzer &amp;amp; Ruch 2012] Using signature strengths can turn a job into “a true calling”. As a result, you can find ways to use your signature strengths at your job to improve your job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[VIA Institute on Character][http://www.viacharacter.org/www/] provides a questionnaire (free, but registration is required) 
to estimate your signature strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to signature strengths, our good job should bring us into “flow”.
There is a book “Flow” by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow - the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in feeling of energized focus,
full involvement and enjoyment (aka “the zone”) and loses track of time. E.g. when doing sport, music, work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenging but attainable goals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strong focused concentration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;activity is intrinsically rewarding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;feeling of serenity (the state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;loss of self-consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;timelessness / losing track of time passing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lack of awareness of physical needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;complete focus on the activity itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve flow, you must have good skills in the activity and it must be challenging enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny fact that even here we miswant. [Lefevre 1988] In work situations we experience high challenge and use our skills, which
brings sense of efficacy and self-confidence. In leisure we instead do low challenge/low skill (e.g. watching TV) and this
causes apathy and boredom. We try to put ourselves in this leisure state assuming that it will make us happier (we would rather
rest and keep resting instead of working). We can choose more challenging leisure activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a good job = signature strengths + flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good grades.&lt;/strong&gt;
Extrinsic motivation = engaging in a behavior in order to earn external rewards or avoid punishments.
Intrinsic motivation = engaging in a behavior because you enjoy the activity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extrinsic motivation can undermine intrinsic motivation. [Deci 1971] When people were asked to do a puzzle in 3 visits, the ones paid during their second visit (extrinsic motivation) worked much less on it during their third visit (seconds of work during each of the visits for the group, which was paid during the second visit: 248, 314 (paid), 199, control (not paid at all) - 214, 206, 242).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on grades (extrinsic) can undermine intrinsic motivation (you enjoying the subject). It can also undermine growth mindset.
There is a book about growth mindset called “Mindset” by Carol Dweck.
Growth mindset = the belief that intelligence can be trained and that most basic abilities can be developed through dedication
and hard work.
Fixed mindset = the belief that basic qualities like intelligence and talent are fixed traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of grades they can be compared as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;33%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;33%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;33%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Fixed&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Growth&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;focus on&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;grades&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;learning, not outcomes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;believing that good performance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;comes naturally&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;takes hard work&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hard work&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“if I have to work, then I’m not smart”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;good, that’s how you get better&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;effort&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bad sign&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;good sign&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;deficiencies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;conceal and hide&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;make the most out of them&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mistakes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;conceal and hide&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;capitalize on them&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Grant &amp;amp; Dweck 2003] Students with growth mindset have higher grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed mindset helps when you already have good skills - “I’m smart, I just need to prove this one more time”,
i.e. when you stay at already high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Mangels et al 2006] Fixed mindset people focus more on feedback (whether their answer was correct),
while growth mindset - on the correct answer (how this should have been done and how I can improve).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you shouldn’t want good grades, but rather a growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better wantings.&lt;/strong&gt; There is plenty of stuff you should want to become happier, but you don’t yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opportunities to do acts of kindness. Doing acts of kindness (even small, even to random people) boosts your
happiness a lot. [Dunn et al 2008] When people are given 5$ or 20$, they predict that spending the money
on themselves will make them happier than as if they spent them on someone else. They also predict that
spending 20$ is much better than 5$. Actually spending money on others makes you much happier
and the effect of spending 5$ is the same as 20$. [Atkin et al 2008] This holds across cultures and income levels.
E.g. in countries where 5$ is a lot of money, spending them on others still makes people happier. 
Possible explanation of why this works - our brain sees the rewards other people get as our own rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social connection. [Myers 2000] People with close social ties are less vulnerable to premature death, more likely to survive
fatal illnesses and less likely to fall prey to stressful events. [Diener &amp;amp; Seligmann 2000] Happy people have more close friends, strong family ties and romantic relationships. Happy people spend more time with family, friends or their lover.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Epley &amp;amp; Schroeder 2014] Even small random connections (e.g. talking to strangers in public transport) boost happiness.
People mispredict this, they choose solitude which makes them unhappy. People you talk to also feel better afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Boothby et al 2014] Same chocolate tastes more delicious and has richer flavor if you happen to be in the same room with 
someone tasting the same chocolate (you don’t see them, you just know that they are there).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Social connection makes the life even richer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interesting random quote: “Happiness is like a leaky tire - after a good movie you don’t stay happy forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time affluence. This is a feeling like you have enough time to do the things you actually want to do.
[Whillans et al 2016] Prioritizing time over money was associated with greater happiness.
[Hershfield et al 2016] However, more people (69%) value money over time. Those who value time are happier.
[Mogilner 2010] People, who were primed to think about time, socialized more in a cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing time makes you happier and more social (this helps with social connection above as well).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling your own mind. Mind-wandering - a shift in the content of thoughts away from an ongoing task and/or 
from events in the external environment to self-generated thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Killingsworth &amp;amp; Gilbert 2010] Our minds wander 46.9% of the time. Why so much? Default network - a network of interacting
brain regions known to activate “by default” when a person is not involved in a task. This network is very fast (activates
in a fraction of a second after a task). It thinks outside here &amp;amp; now (past, future, other people).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mind-wandering is a cognitive achievement (animals don’t usually think about past or future or can’t do this at all).
It affects all activities (except sex - in this case the degree is smaller) and has negative impact on happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How to stop mind-wandering? Meditation - a practice of turning your attention away from distracting thoughts toward a single
point of reference (e.g. breath, bodily sensations, compassion, a specific thought). Examples of meditation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;loving kindness (thinking about the fact that you care about someone and you want them to be happy and healthy)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;focusing on breath&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;choiceless awareness (noticing how thoughts appear in your mind and letting them go instead of following them)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Brewer et al 2011] Meditation practice can curb mind-wandering (even outside of meditation). Thus, meditation can make us happier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Hölzel et al 2011] Meditation (27 min/day for 8 weeks) causes increase of gray matter content in brain.
[Mrazek et al 2013] Meditation (4 * 45 min during 2 weeks + 10-20 min of mindfulness exercises) boosts GRE performance.
[Hutcherson et al 2008] Loving kindness meditation on some person increases your social kindness to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Overall meditation can make you happier by shutting down mind-wandering, boosting social kindness (and as a result
connections) or just performing better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise. [Babyak et al 2000] Exercise treats depression better than medicine (90% recovery rate for a group doing
30 min 3 times/week for 16 weeks vs 60% for anti-depressant Zoloff group). [Hillman et al 2008] Exercise improves
cognitive function. There is a connection between academic achievement and physical fitness scores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sleep. Sleeping not enough (~5 hours) [Dinges et al 1997] affects your mood and increases physical and emotional complaints.
Good sleep also has other benefits [Walker et al 2002, Wagner at al 2004].&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;How to apply?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just knowing about all of these is not enough to put this into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gi-joe-fallacy&quot;&gt;G.I. Joe Fallacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is a cartoon, which everyone in the US knows and not many outside do.
The cartoon was meant to teach kids and the main hero (G.I. Joe) often said “Knowing is half the battle”.
However, this is not true. Just knowing is not enough to change how you think and behave.
One needs to change their habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to get beyond just knowing that we should want these things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies for creating better habits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;situation-support&quot;&gt;Situation support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situation affects us more than we think (e.g. having food around promotes eating, having someone typing on their phone 
makes you check your social networks). Situations can cause unhealthy behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a book “Slim by Design” by Brian Wansink which considers situation support in the context of losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Painter et al 2002] Proximity of a candy jar (either on the desk or two meters away) increases candy consumption by 48%.
Having a candy jar in drawer (not immediately visible) causes 25% smaller consumption. Thus, visibility and convenience in which
you can engage in your habits both matter. You can do this in negative ways (keeping candies visible) or in positive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Wansink et al 2016] Having cookies, chips, cereal and soda visible on your kitchen counter increases average weight by 10 kg.
Fresh fruit and vegetables - decreases by 5 kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should fix bad environments (get rid of stuff that is tempting you, e.g. delete a social media app from the phone). This way
you will have fewer bad cues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should promote healthy environments (e.g. having physical notes and reminders around you). Social context (having others doing 
a positive habit around you) promotes the habit and increases kindness and social connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goal-setting&quot;&gt;Goal setting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about goals in very specific ways can help you achieve them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal specificity.&lt;/strong&gt; The degree of quantitative precision with which a goal is specified (i.e. “lose weight” vs “lose 1 kg during April”, “meditate” vs “when, how frequently, how long”). Specificity seems to give you a plan how to achieve the task.
[Klein et al 1990] With goal specificity people naturally develop task strategy, which boosts their performance. Specificity forces 
you to think how you are going to do the task.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thus, whatever goals you have - make them incredibly specific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal visualization.&lt;/strong&gt; Mental contrasting = a visualization technique involving thinking of a positive future outcome followed
by thinking of obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you just think about positive outcome, then you don’t get closer to the goal, you just feel better. If you think only about 
obstacles, then you will be demotivated to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Stadler et al 2010] Mental contrasting had positive effect even after 24 months when taught to women trying to eat more fruits/vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thus, don’t just visualize the good part of the outcome, but take time to consider obstacles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal planning.&lt;/strong&gt; When you are in a particular situation, it will implicitly affect you (thinking “grab the pizza” when seeing pizza
in the canteen). How to intervene even though this happens implicitly? There is a way to have an implicit plan as well. It
allows you to get through situations like this automatically (without having to apply much willpower).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Implementation intention - a self regulatory strategy in the form of an “if then” plan that can lead to better goal attainment.
During preparation you can visualize “if I’m in the dining hall and I see pizza, I will turn back and grab the orange”. Our
automatic system can pay attention to this “if then” plan if you put in that level of specificity. Peter Gollwitzer researches
this topic in more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This can also be used to remember stuff (e.g. “when I grab the door knob, think about keys”).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[Gollwitzer and Brandstaetter 1997] For easy goals implementation helps a little bit, for hard - a lot (success rate of achieving
the goal increases from 25% to 65%).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting all goal strategies above together.&lt;/strong&gt;
WOOP method (wish, outcome, obstacle, plan):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about your wish (as specific as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best outcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potential obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your if/then plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a book “Rethinking Positive Thinking” by Oettingen about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider each step in more details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wish. What is my most important wish (for a given time-frame)? What do I want today? What do I want next week?
Isolate one important wish, formulate it with 3-4 words and put it in front of your mind. At this stage you just search for the right wish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would be the best outcome if I fulfill that wish? Search for the best outcome and formulate it in 3-4 works. Again put
it in front of your mind. Then imagine the best outcome - just let your mind go. This is not a search anymore, but imagining and
experiencing. Take at most 1 minute to really feel the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of dreaming about the outcome all the time, you now switch gears. What is my main [inner] obstacle? What is it in me?
This can be emotion, irrational belief, bad habit, something someone had said. Formulate it with 3-4 words and put it in from of
your mind. Now imagine the obstacle and experience it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What could I do to overcome that obstacle? Formulate this in 3-4 words and put in front of your mind. Make a simple if-then plan. If &lt;obstacle&gt;, &lt;my action=&quot;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/my&gt;&lt;/obstacle&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that WOOP can be used to overcome inner obstacles and to understand yourself better. The example above is about
understanding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes more mental effort than just indulging in fantasies. However, this mental effort triggers your unconscious which
does a lot of work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use WOOP to find out whether something is feasible or even to let go less feasible wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise links the obstacle to the wish together with instruments to overcome the obstacle. It also changes the meaning
of the reality - you now recognize that there is an obstacle. This allows you later to do automatically what you want to do.
Recognizing the obstacle is the most important part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do WOOP at the same place and time to establish a ritual. You don’t need to it perfectly. WOOP changes with life,
because positive fantasies come from our needs (deficiencies) and they change with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important: don’t switch o’s. Once you think about obstacle first, it won’t work anymore, because you can discover the real obstacle
only in the framework of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">I took &quot;The science of wellbeing&quot; course at Coursera.

It is very interesting. Here is my summary of the first three lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-1-introduction-to-human-behavioral-biology&quot;&gt;Lecture 1: “Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-course-is-about&quot;&gt;What the course is about&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is common between “having a period”, “having a brain tumor”, “eating a lot of junk food” and “taking anabolic steroids”?
All have been successfully used in courts as a defense for a murderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points of the course:
1) Sometimes what happens in your body can dramatically influence what happens in your brain (examples above).
2) Sometimes something in your head can affect your entire body (e.g. when one imagines that they will die
their heart starts beating faster).
In other words, the course is about the connection between physiology and behavior, emotions, memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;categorical-thinking&quot;&gt;Categorical thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We divide everything into categories, because this makes it easier to store information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/1_spectrum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration of spectrum divided into categories&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. it is much easier to remember whether you saw a triangle, a square or a circle than some weird shape,
because we don’t have a word (i.e. a category) for latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages of categorical thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can’t differentiate two facts that fall in the same category (b &amp;amp; p in Finnish or two similar colors) - you underestimate their difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have trouble seeing how similar things are right across the category boundaries (e.g. 65% on the test leads to fail and 66% to pass) - we overestimate the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you pay attention to boundaries, you miss the big picture (e.g. phone numbers are supposed to be 3 digits followed by 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-categorical-thinking&quot;&gt;Avoiding categorical thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the course is to think about biology of behavior without falling into categorical thinking.
The category (bucket) you are in affects how you explain the world. We want to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main challenges - recognizing when we:
1) just like other animals and accepting that. E.g. ovulation synchronization in females living together.
2) we appear to be like any other organism, but do something very different.
Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chess master capturing a piece feeling like a baboon who won a fight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we get stressed when reading something bad happening to a character in a novel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can feel compassionate about other species. This is the same physiology as in other animals, but we use it in unrecognizable ways.
3) do something that no other animal even remotely does (e.g. non-reproductive sex, language use).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course we will overview various buckets first - evolution, molecular genetics.
Then we will look at behaviors and consider them through each bucket separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-2-behavioral-evolution-i&quot;&gt;Lecture 2: Behavioral Evolution I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin didn’t discover evolution. He came up with a mechanism for it - natural selection.
Darwinian evolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are heritable traits (i.e. genetic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is variability among those traits (ways in which they can occur)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some versions of those traits are more adaptive (work better for you) then others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this is not about survival, but reproduction.
When you have all of these, you get evolution and populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add mutations - you can get large changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies well to physiology, but how to apply this to behavior? Exactly the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are heritable behaviors (i.e. behaviors have genetic components, this is an important assumption)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;types/classes of behaviors have variation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some are more adaptive than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a false belief that &lt;del&gt;“animals behave for the good of the species”&lt;/del&gt;.
Actually animals behave to pass as many copies of their genes as possible (reproduction of the fittest).
Sometimes this may look like behavior for the good of the species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ways to pass your genes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individual selection - maximize number of times you reproduce through natural selection (useful traits improving
adaptability) and sexual selection (arbitrary traits).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kin selection - helping out relatives to reproduce (cooperate with relatives to a different degree, which depends on how
closely they are related to you) by decreasing your own reproductive success.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reciprocal altruism - cooperation among non-relatives, but it must be reciprocal (you must get something out of it and not
more than you put it), e.g. group hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prisoner-dilemma&quot;&gt;Prisoner Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal altruism leads to cheating and being good at detecting cheating against you. When to cheat and when to cooperate is studied in game theory. The basic “model” is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;Prisoner Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tit-for-tat-strategy&quot;&gt;“Tit for Tat” strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cooperate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next time:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If they cooperated last time, you cooperate&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Otherwise you cheat&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nice (kind)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retaliates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forgiving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deterministic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drives other strategies into extinction when multiple agents play multiples games with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a vulnerability - signal error. 
What if there is a possibility of a mistake (noise in the signal),
e.g. cooperation looks like cheating.
This wipes out 50% of cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ++-+-+...
  +++-+-...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;forgiving-tit-for-tat-ftft&quot;&gt;Forgiving Tit for Tat (fTfT)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved version of TfT. 
Like normal TfT but after “saw pattern” for 5 rounds - forgive and cooperate.
fTfT outcompetes TfT when you can have signal error.
It has another vulnerability - it can be exploited by strategies without forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tft---ftft&quot;&gt;“Tft -&amp;gt; fTfT”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start off with pure TfT. If for N rounds the other party didn’t cheat, switch to fTfT.
I.e. you begin to “trust” someone and this protects you from signal error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pavlov&quot;&gt;Pavlov&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do something and I get rewarded, do it again next time. If I lose, I switch.
This allows you to exploit someone, who is forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random mention: “The political uses of madness” - an article by Daniel Ellsburg on the optimal benefits of perceived madness 
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/ThePoliticalUsesOfMadness&quot;&gt;source1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ia600102.us.archive.org/20/items/ThePoliticalUsesOfMadness/ELS005-001.pdf&quot;&gt;source2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;examples-in-nature&quot;&gt;Examples in nature&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vampire bats. Females share their nest with non-relatives. Everyone feeds all babies.
When they think that one female cheats on them, they stop feeding her kids.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;black hamlet fish. They can change their gender. Pair of them flip their gender back and forth. Being female
is more “expensive”. If one fish ends up being a male too many times, other fish will stop cooperating with them
(TfT).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lion. Non-relatives in a pride. If you fake a sound of other lion in the bush, in many prides one lion
stays behind the group, while all other go to check and risk by doing this. However, this lion is not punished.
In real world you can have many ongoing games at the same time or others just don’t pay attention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;naked mole-rat. Big cooperative colonies (possibly non-relatives). 1-2 animals don’t do any work, but no 
one punishes them. They are even larger, because they eat more. However, when the rainy season comes
they plug the entry to the tunnel with their bodies (example of another ongoing “game” and role
diversification).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-to-behavior-analysis&quot;&gt;Application to behavior analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to use the fact that species maximize copies of their genes to analyze behavior? 
Imagine that we have two skulls - one male and one female.
Just by their relative size to each other we can conclude a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Males much larger&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Males the same&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;male aggression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;high (their body is built for this and females select for this)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;variability in male reproductive success&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;high (5% males do 95% of reproduction)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;low (every male gets 1-2 kids)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;what females want&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;large body size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“good personality” - parental behavior (e.g. male birds bring food to females as
evidence that they can feed kids)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;parental behavior in males&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;low (not interested in kids)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;high (care about kids)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;life span&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;high variation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no difference by gender&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;twinning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rare (impossible to feed on your own)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;more frequent (male helps to feed)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;kids abandonment by females&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rare (kids will die for sure, male won’t take care)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;more frequent (male will feed them anyway)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;species kind&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tournament&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;pair bonding monogamous&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;example&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;peacock (feathers show that you can waste a lot of energy)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tamarin monkey (one can’t distinguish males and females visually)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could see this only by ratio of male and female skull sizes.
Humans fall in between these two kinds of species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-3-behavioral-evolution-ii&quot;&gt;Lecture 3: Behavioral Evolution II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use “individual maximizes number of copies of their genes” to explain more behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;explaining-infanticide&quot;&gt;Explaining infanticide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies are cute - they are trying to reduce aggression by this. There are species with infanticide (e.g. lions).
Patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adult male is the one killing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infants who are most likely to be offsprings of other males are killed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;average interbirth interval in females is larger than the average tenure of high ranking male.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the new alpha male e.g. just killed the previous one, but all females won’t ovulate
for 2.5 years, while you will be alpha male only for 1.5 years. Thus, by killing kids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reproductive success of other males is decreased&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;females will start ovulating sooner (by stopping nursing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates that individuals optimize number of copies of their genes instead of doing good for the species.
Another example is mountain gorilla. They have infanticide even though they are at risk of extinction. 
In other words, they even endanger their species more to increase their own reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peculiarly infanticide does not happen if previous alpha was a relative.
Two male lions can even share a pride of they are brothers (adelphic polyandry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Females have developed number of adaptations due to this as well.
In some species females have spontaneous abortion due to smell of the new male
(there is no point to invest more resources into the kid, since it will be killed anyway).
Females can also try to protect their kids. If they are older, they will risk their life more
(they are less likely to have another kid). Maternal grandmothers defend even more (they won’t
reproduce at all).
Another strategy is to have pseudo estrous (i.e. fake ovulation) during pregnancy.
The new male mates and thinks that the kid is his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baboons do blackmail kidnaping of kids. If alpha attacks an individual, they can grab
alpha’s kid implying “attack me and I will kill the kid”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gender-ratio-fluctuations&quot;&gt;Gender ratio fluctuations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tournament species having a son is a volatile way (gamble) to pass your genes (may work out
very well, but most likely won’t). Having a daughter is a conservative way (they will have few kids,
but with high probability). However, giving birth to a male requires more energy. Higher 
ranking females have more sons (can take the risks). During environment distress (e.g. famine)
more daughters are born. This can produce sex ratio fluctuations (having sons is better
when there are few males).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intrasexual-competition&quot;&gt;Intrasexual competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Males and females can have different reproductive goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved by means of imprinted genes - their effect depends on which parent they come from.
There is a genetic mechanism to achieve this. Examples of such genes and their usage in intrasexual competition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Imprinted genes coming from father tend to improve fetal growth (i.e. the kid should get as much energy from
the female as possible, males in migratory species do not care about future reproduction of a particular female,
but only about their kid).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From mother - slow down fetal development (this particular kid is less important to a female than their overall
reproductive life).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mechanism malfunctions if one of the genes gets disabled due to a mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are imprinted genes, which work only after birth. E.g. from male one can get “suck more milk” (i.e.
get more calories from female). You only see this in tournament species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have imprinted genes. By their quantity we are again in between pair bonding and tournament species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is sperm competition in polyandrous species.
In some fly species sperm makes toxins that kill sperm of other males.
However, they cause harm to females too.
This makes no sense for the good of species,
but does for individual success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;direction-of-male-aggression&quot;&gt;Direction of male aggression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are species (e.g. chimpanzee) with exogamy (individuals leaving the group after puberty to avoid
interbreading). If males leave the group - you get high aggression inside the group among males (they 
are not relatives). If females - among groups (chimpanzee genocide and border patrols). Human military tries
to create this kinship artificially, chimpanzees have it by nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cooperation&quot;&gt;Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start cooperation by reintroducing highly interbread group (close relatives) into general population.
This small group can outcompete others (due to their kinship) and others are forced to start cooperating as well.
This is a push towards group selection (highly interbread group with kinship cooperation can drive others who don’t cooperate
to extinction). In humans - trust in business or low interest loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the case that strategy A dominates B when there is only one individual in each group,
but A is dominated by B when there are many individuals in each group. E.g. a group of aggressive chickens would
injure each other. However, when there are only two chickens, an aggressive one will outperform non-aggressive.
This is a group selection as well (but due to personal benefit in the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we observe multilevel selection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;single gene level&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;individual&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;criticism&quot;&gt;Criticism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticism of applying Darwinian principles to behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heritability of behavior - what are the molecular principles driving this?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adaptiveness - everything you see has an adaptive explanation for
why it emerged evolutionarily - there are non-adaptive traits. 
Why do humans have chins? Otherwise you can’t get a flat face. These are so called
spandrel traits, they are just an inevitable result of other traits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradualism - evolutionary change occurs in gradual incremental steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also political criticism - founding social biologists were white south American males (i.e. 
they could just be justifying male domination because this is positive for them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was strolling around the supermarket, busy checking all the discounts available.
I quickly checked the baking section and then noticed something odd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/crazy_pistachio/crazy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dr.Oetker chopped pistachio for baking, 2.49 euro for 25 grams&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we are offered here 25 grams of pistachio (already peeled and chopped) for &lt;em&gt;mere&lt;/em&gt; 2.49 euro.
How kind of them. In other words 100 grams of this goodness brings you back by 9.96 euro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops! That’s a lot. 100 euro per kilo. I can’t remember any other product in an ordinary supermarket
costing something like that (except spices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I normally try to vaguely remember average prices for things I buy, I quickly checked my ordinary source of
pistachio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/crazy_pistachio/sane.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Bravo&amp;quot; non-peeled pistachio, 3.19 euro for 250 grams&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, just looking at them makes me feel better (after 100 euro per kilo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here your suspicion level should raise and you should ask me: “Wait, but these are not peeled, are you trying to fool us?”.
Yeap, they are not peeled. However, &lt;em&gt;peeling loss percentage&lt;/em&gt; for pistachio is 38.26%-43.39%. No worries, I just learned
that there is “peeling loss percentage” as well. Now you are wondering how I knew that. Apparently people write peer reviewed
articles about this and I took the numbers from “Physical properties of pistachio nut and its kernel as a function of moisture content and variety. Part II. Gravimetrical properties” by Seyed M.A.Razavi et al. Google scholar reports that this article
has 53 citations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to our pistachio. Let’s say the shell takes 50% of weight. Thus, in the second case after peeling pistachio on our own
(I know, it is hard to believe that this is possible (at least according to Dr.Oetker), but bear with me) we get 125 grams for 3.19 euro, which is equivalent to 2.55 euro for 100 grams, i.e. almost 4 times cheaper than the first options. “Hey, wait, but these are not chopped?” - em, we can chop them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the saddest part is that I saw this in the supermarket, which means that this is actually pretty profitable,
otherwise they would have stopped doing this much earlier. I honestly can’t imagine people buying this.
Perhaps they are in extreme hurry to bake a pistachio cake and then they run as fast as they can to the supermarket,
directly to the baking section, grab everything chaotically and run away paying as they leave. Or they need precisely 25 grams
of pistachio and they have less than 3.19 euro available to them. Or they don’t know that 3.19 euro option exists. Or they are scared
of peeling pistachio. Or they don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I needed exactly 25 grams of pistachio (not sure why, but oh well), I just couldn’t buy this Dr.Oetker package.
I would rather buy 250 grams, peel them, take 25 grams and freeze the rest or just eat it thinking about how peculiar the
world is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that even though we just saved a bunch of money by peeling and chopping some pistachios on our own, pistachio is still
on the expensive side (25 euro per kilo). You should definitely keep this in mind when selecting your nuts.
You may get the desired effect (or pretty comparable) by buying much cheaper nuts and, thus, saving even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;german-brokers-all-do-german-taxes-for-you&quot;&gt;German brokers (all do German taxes for you)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All German brokers do all the taxes for you and take the money to pay the tax away before you get your dividends.
This is convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;constant-transaction-fee&quot;&gt;Constant transaction fee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these brokers your transaction fee does not depend on the amount of money in the transaction.
I’ve already wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/post/underestimating-ter&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; why this is good and how
much money one can save with such a broker (spoiler: more than you think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flatex&quot;&gt;flatex&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatex takes a constant fee (5.9 EUR). Some pages are available in English, but the trading interface
and customer service aren’t (however, some people there agreed to speak English). Still better than nothing, since I am
not aware of any other German broker having anything in English.
As was said above, Flatex (like any other German broker) does taxes (they even take the money for tax away before you actually get your dividends).
If you hold EUR with them, you will pay 0.4% per year from its amount. However, this applies
only to EUR, not ETFs or stock. If you are going to buy stocks, there is a 5.9 EUR fee for stock dividends
larger than 15 EUR (this does not apply to ETFs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;onvista&quot;&gt;onvista&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onvista has been bought recently by comdirect. They also have a constant fee (5 EUR), but only
in their Festdepot. If you use Free-buy mode, selling (or buying without a free buy) costs
0.23% (min 5.99, max 39 eur), which is comparable to all other percentage-based fee brokers. Moreover, Free-buy mode
seems to be a temporary deal and the current end date is 31.12.2019. Moreover it applies only to some
ETFs and only to some amounts of money (&amp;gt;= 1500 EUR per order) and to actually get at least one free
buy you have to have done a 2000 EUR transaction in the previous month. They do German taxes as well.
The only disadvantage is that they accept only citizens of Germany, France, Ireland, Austria, Luxemburg, Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finanzennet&quot;&gt;finanzen.net&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a wrapper around onvista Festdepot (even their price conditions have exactly the same formating and styling, just a 
different color). And guess what - they also accept only citizens of Germany, France, Ireland, Austria, Luxemburg, Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;percentage-based-transaction-fee&quot;&gt;Percentage-based transaction fee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these brokers your transaction fee depends on the amount of money in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ing-diba&quot;&gt;Ing Diba&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.25% (min 4.9, max 69.9). Nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comdirect&quot;&gt;comdirect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.25% (min 9.9, max 59.9). The account is free only for the first 3 years,
after that it costs 1.95 EUR per month, unless you do at least 2 thread per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;max-blue&quot;&gt;max blue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.25% (min 8.9, max 49.9). Owned by Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dkb&quot;&gt;DKB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DKB decided to be original with their pricing.
For transaction below 10k, you pay 10 EUR, above 10k - 25 eur.
This is actually extremely expensive when investing monthly,
e.g. for 1k you lose 1% due to this fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consorsbank&quot;&gt;Consorsbank&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.25% (min 9.95, max 69)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-german-brokers-no-more-german-taxes-for-you&quot;&gt;Non-German brokers (no more German taxes for you)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brokers in this category don’t do any taxes for you.
You can get a list of your transactions from them,
but you will have to figure out how much taxes to pay yourself.
May be not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-brokers&quot;&gt;Interactive Brokers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IB has 2 modes of pricing - fixed and tiered.
In fixed you pay 0.1% (min 4, max 29), in tiered 0.08% (min 1.25, max 29).
I wrote in great details about them &lt;a href=&quot;/post/interactive-brokers-fixed-vs-tiered-commissions&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;,
including which one is better and when (spoiler: tiered, practically always).
IB is a very advanced broker. Many use it for professional trading. 
As a result the learning curve is steep.
E.g. just buying ETFs is already non-trivial 
(&lt;a href=&quot;/post/interactive-brokers-buying-etfs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is my post about this).
On the other hand you get access to a lot of exchanges and this access is much more
direct than what you get at any of the german brokers (they simplify the process a lot).
Also IB has good currency exchange fees (0.2%) and API, so you can automate the process.
The downside - 10 USD fee per month, which is counted against your transaction fees.
That is if you spend 5 EUR for transactions, you pay only 10 USD - 5 EUR at the end of 
the month. If you have more than 100k USD with them (or equivalent, e.g. ETFs or stocks or EUR),
the fee is waived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lynx&quot;&gt;Lynx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German wrapper around IB.
Each transaction costs 0.14% (min 5.8, max 99),
which is cheaper than normal German brokers, but you get no taxes done here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;degiro&quot;&gt;degiro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.038% (min 2). Degiro is cheap, but there is a lot of controversy around them.
First, they have two kinds of accounts - basic and custody.
In basic one, they can lend your securities to other people to make money,
but not for you. As a result, there is some risk that the people won’t return
your securities. Theoretically the broker should manage this risk, but stuff happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting peculiarity is that Degiro is associated with a hedge fund and there is
presumably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amsterdamtrader.com/2015/09/degiro-clients-as-counterparty-for-hedgefund.html&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt;
that this hedge fund has abused their position and took advantage of Degiro clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeFIRE/comments/6j50yz/brokers_you_get_what_you_pay_for/&quot;&gt;This great post on reddit&lt;/a&gt;
considers all the disadvantages in more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since investing in ETFs is a long term game, using a controversial broker sounds silly,
so I personally wouldn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer easy level of difficulty for your German taxes, then go with some of constant fee German ones (flatex or onvista).
If you happen to use the percentage based fee one, consider switching. I wrote about this already,
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/underestimating-ter&quot;&gt;working 2.4 month full time just for your broker&lt;/a&gt; does not sound
fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t mind doing the taxes on your own, but want more hard core experience and more possibilities,
go with IB. This works especially well when you expect to have 100k USD with them soonish or 
do frequent currency exchange or buy some exotic financial instruments. This will also be cheaper 
than using any constant fee German brokers (assuming 100k USD with them and investing 1-2k EUR per month).&lt;/p&gt;

could be used as a model for learning and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief-overview-of-the-rules&quot;&gt;Brief overview of the rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominion is a deck building game. The building happens during the game itself in contrast 
to collectable card games. In other words, there is no way to buy fancy cards in advance and have
advantage in the game. Instead all players start with the same default set of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player has their own deck and they draw cards from there.
When they have used their entire deck, they just shuffle the cards and use it again.
Each card has some meaning (either as a currency or allowing you to do some action).
One can buy new cards and add them to their deck.
The set of actions (as a result, cards) is very diverse (e.g. they can directly affect other players or allow you to remove cards from your deck). 
Some cards represent “victory points” (usually with no value apart from that, so getting them in your hand
is inconvenient, because you can’t play them). One maximizes number of victory points in their deck to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analogy&quot;&gt;Analogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dominion one needs to buy good cards as early as possible.
This way they maximize card lifetime utility - the earlier it is bought, the more it will be used.
I find this a good analogy for learning in life. One should learn good skills as early as possible.
As a result, this will increase skill utility by increasing the time when you could apply them.
Thus, buying a card in Dominion is like learning something in life. You want to do it as early as possible.
It will probably be useful and there is cost attached as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the analogy, shuffling the deck and drawing random cards in Dominion can be seen as
encountering random challenges and opportunities in life. How you react to them depends on your skill set.
Having a good cards (skill set) makes it easier to buy new cards (learn new skills).
This way you can get something similar to skill “compounding”. E.g. if one skill saves you time, 
you can use this time to learn more skills, which can save even more time and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a limited number of cards available to the players overall and players in some sense compete for them.
Thus, the same card can have very different utility in different games based on decisions of other players.
For example, you can buy some card to attack others, but if they all bought plenty of “protection” cards blocking
your attack, this makes your attacking card much less valuable to you. 
Similarly with skills, each skill can have different utility depending on how many other people have it.
Thus, one should keep in mind the demand when assessing skill usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-analogy-breaks&quot;&gt;Where analogy breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a random analogy, which I found interesting enough to share.
Obviously, for some parts of the game it does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in Dominion everyone starts with the same deck, which is definitely not true in life.
One may get approximately same skill set when they are born, but they definitely
have different opportunities later in life (e.g. due to financial status of their parents or their nationality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that in Dominion one buys special victory point cards to win.
That’s for sure not how life works. Just understanding what it means to “win” in life
can easily be a life long goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn good skills early!&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s calculate this difference. Moreover, let’s consider other kinds of fees and their impact on a long-term ETF investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;classes-of-fees&quot;&gt;Classes of fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When investing, I define 4 classes of fees based on their nature (i.e. how and when they are applied):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yearly percentage-based&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One time percentage-based&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yearly constant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One time constant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider examples for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yearly-percentage-based&quot;&gt;Yearly percentage-based&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your financial adviser (fund) takes X% of the money they manage every year as a fee.
For funds, this is called Total Expense Ratio (TER).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-time-percentage-based&quot;&gt;One time percentage-based&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker takes X% of the money during the transaction e.g. when buying or selling ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yearly-constant&quot;&gt;Yearly constant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker takes X euro each year e.g. as an account management fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-time-constant&quot;&gt;One time constant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker takes X euro during the transaction e.g. when buying or selling ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;their-impact&quot;&gt;Their impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classes above are ordered based on how badly they can affect you when you invest long-term.
Yearly percentage-based fee is the worst offender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yearly-percentage-based-1&quot;&gt;Yearly percentage-based&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel when you see 1% yearly fee? Before I started looking into investing,
I did consider this cheap and not that important. I speculate that we get conditioned
during our life to some scale of numbers, which mostly works in ordinary life situations.
E.g. if the price for a bus ticket increases 1%, this would be a minor nuisance.
And we naturally use the same logic when we first get to investing.
1% yearly fee - sounds low enough to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, investing is different from ordinary life due to compounding
and exponential growth, which we rarely observe otherwise. As a result, our heuristical rules
 don’t work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider an example. We invest 1000 euro in two assets (e.g. funds). Both assets 
have 4% after inflation yearly return, but the first asset has 1% yearly fees, while the second &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 0.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first year, we will have 1000 * 1.04 = 1040 in both assets before applying the fees.
After the fees it is 1040 * 0.99 = 1029.6 in 1% fee asset and 1040 * 0.991 = 1030.64 in 0.9% one.
At this stage the difference is only 1.04 euro. However, we are long term investors here and our timeline spans 30-60 years.
As a result, we are also missing future returns attached to this 1.04 euro. E.g. with 4% yearly growth, in 30 years it becomes
1.04 * 1.04^30 = 3.37 euro. 
Please note that the growth is after inflation, so these are today’s euros in terms of inflation.
As a result, 1.04 euro we payed in the fees in the future becomes 3.37 inflation adjusted euros, they just don’t go
into our pocket (or rather brokerage account) anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, it still may look like I am crazy. We are discussing here 3.37 euro in the future 
and losing ~5 euros is not a life changing event.
However, this fee is applied each year and the numbers add up.
After 30 years, the difference is 69.23 euro (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t02HivZF_u40cJXL_E_osgcCK_6dEeoJ8NAhv5CRkDs/edit&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, make a copy if you would like to play with it). This doesn’t look much, but the overall value of your
0.9%-fee investment after 30 years is 2399.4 euro and this difference is 2.88% of the overall value.
In other words by choosing 0.9% yearly fee investment instead of 1%, you get 2.88% more money in 30 years
(assuming investing only once and 4% after inflation return).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, investing 1000 euro once is unusual, we all invest monthly instead. What happens in this case?
The relative effect of this fee difference decreases, because the later investments have less exposure to the yearly fee.
However, since the overall value now is much larger, the absolute effect of the fee is much larger as well.
E.g. if we invest 1000 euro every month, after 30 years the difference is 1.61%
(8810 euro difference with 548068 total, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t02HivZF_u40cJXL_E_osgcCK_6dEeoJ8NAhv5CRkDs/edit#gid=1042145595&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is not too bad, right? What is all the fuss about?
It is actually pretty bad. Above I took a pretty mild case of 0.9% vs 1%.
In real life you can easily get 1% mutual fund yearly fee and 0.1% ETF fee.
If you invest 1000 euro once (under same assumptions as above), after 30 years the difference between
1% and 0.1% yearly fee funds values will be 23% (699 euro difference with 3029 total for 0.1% one fund).
So going from 1% to 0.1% brings you almost a quarter more money in 30 years.
Would anyone here by any chance like to improve your investment return by guaranteed mere 23% in 30 years (equivalent to 0.6% yearly)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you invest 1000 euro monthly, the difference is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 13% (85834 euro with 625092 total for 0.1% fund).
As a reminder, these are inflation adjusted (i.e. today’s euros). So going from 1% to 0.1% fee fund brings you almost 100k more here. Looks like this is a good compensation for paying attention to fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that now 1% yearly fee brings some weird feeling of opposition deep inside you
and you immediately imagine 0.1% (or even 0.07%) instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-time-percentage-based-1&quot;&gt;One time percentage-based&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have considered the elephant in the room (yearly percentage based fees), but there are 
more ways to lose (or save) money when investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider one time percentage-based fees. In order to invest you need a broker and all
brokers want something in return for their service.
Some brokers want a part of the money you invest as a fee for the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany I often see 0.25% per transaction (e.g. Ing Diba, maxblue). 
Sometimes brokers have “saving plan” &lt;em&gt;deal&lt;/em&gt; and there it can be even larger (0.4% at maxblue).
Worth noting that they also have minimal and maximal fees per transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For maxblue the limits are 8.9 and 49.9 if you use normal brokerage and no limits for saving plans.
On one hand this is nice for us, because if you decide (for some weird reason) to sell all your ETFs
and they are worth 1 million, you will pay not 2500 euro, but just 49.9 euro.
Unfortunately, this is the only advantage and how often do you do 1 million transactions these days?
On the other hand, the minimal fee penalizes you &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; if you buy ETFs monthly (not as badly as yearly percentage
fees above, but we like to optimize stuff). E.g. if you buy with 1000 euro, you won’t pay 2.5 euro, but 8.9.
If you buy with 100 euro, the situation is even worse - instead of 0.25, you still pay 8.9 (almost 10%, don’t do this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, when investing moderate amounts monthly, minimal fee affects your return badly.
I think the default solution to this is to have a saving plan instead.
E.g. for maxblue, you will pay 0.4% of the transaction amount, but only when &lt;strong&gt;buying&lt;/strong&gt;, and
0.25% with 8.9 and 49.9 limits when selling. So when buying for 100 euro, you pay 4 euro instead of 8.9 above.
A bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously you have your own unique circumstances, so you should see for yourself what the best way is.
My main point here - if there is a one time percentage-based fee, take it into account.
E.g. if your broker takes 0.25% without limits for each transaction and you are a long term ETF investor,
effectively you are giving away at least 0.5% of &lt;em&gt;all your net worth&lt;/em&gt;. If the already familiar feeling
of opposition from the previous section didn’t visit you here, please read it again. You pay 0.5% of 
&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; your net worth (my feeling of opposition makes me feel bad even to write this). It’s like you take all
what you earned in your life and then say - oh, I don’t need this two hundreds part of it, please help yourself
my lovely broker.
If your working career was 40 years, this is equivalent to you working at least 2.4 months full time just for your
broker to pay this fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also saying “at least” 0.5%. When you buy, you will definitely pay 0.25%. However, when you sell, the fee
also affects all the growth of your investment. You could consider this as your net worth as well, but this 
is definitely more than 0.5% of all the money you invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can say - oh, this is all very nice, but what do you suggest? 
Yeap, we still need a broker to buy and sell, I agree.
However, there are brokers who don’t have explicit percentage based fees.
E.g. flatex and Onvista (be careful with Onvista, only some account modes (festpreis) don’t have this fee at all,
the free buys one has well hidden 0.25% fee when selling). So check your broker and consider switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that percentage based fee per se is not bad. E.g. flatex takes 5.9 per transaction.
If you invest 100 euro per month, 0.4% at maxblue will be a better deal for your.
Here you should be worried about selling (are you?). As of now, one can theoretically move
their assets from one brokerage account to another (even probably for free, but I am not familiar with this topic).
Thus, theoretically you can buy all your ETFs at one broker for a very long time and after reaching your 
financial goals, just move all your assets to another one, where selling is cheaper for you.
This also partially protects you against your broker changing their fees (e.g. flatex starting to take 10% instead of 5.9).
However, I have no clue whether this applies to saving plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also said “explicit” above. Technically a broker could try to take a percentage based fees
in some other ways (e.g. through spread or poor asset price). I wasn’t able to detect this myself
by comparing prices at different brokers and I assume that governmental regulations forbid this (hey, MiFiD and friends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yearly-constant-1&quot;&gt;Yearly constant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, easy ones now.
Some brokers take some money just for having an account with them (hi, Interactive Brokers).
This is likely much cheaper than 0.5% of all your net worth (otherwise, RUN from a broker like that).
Still you may take it into account. E.g. for Interactive Brokers it is 10 USD assuming that you have
less than 100k USD (or equivalent) with them, so overall 120 USD per year. Not too bad, but spare ~120 USD per year won’t hurt.
However, they count your transaction fees against this monthly fee. In other words in the end of the
month you pay either 10 USD or all your transaction fees if they are in total larger than 10 USD.
So it will be somewhat smaller than 120 USD per year, but not too much if you buy one ETF and only once a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way here is a funny fact about Interactive Brokers and percentage based fees. They have a percentage based fee,
but it is so low that it may be in the end twice cheaper than flatex’s 5.9 euro. So do your math when choosing a broker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-time-constant-1&quot;&gt;One time constant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already explained above some brokers just take some constant fee for each transaction.
I assume that normally you would do 12 transaction per year (+ perhaps 1-5 to rebalance).
So with flatex we are talking about ~5.9 * 12 = ~71 euro (this does not take into account stock exchanges fees,
but we can’t avoid them anyway).
This one has the smallest impact, but you are welcome to take it into account as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose funds with low TER. Train your feeling of opposition when seeing 1% yearly fee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider brokers without percentage based fees transaction fees, but do your math for your specific situation and investing plans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you fancy - take into account broker account fees and constant transaction fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
