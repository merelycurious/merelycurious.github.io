Now I find them very useful
in this new context. E.g. they can be a hint to prioritize and to postpone less important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-todo&quot;&gt;What is a TODO?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TODO is just a comment in the code describing a way to improve a given bit of code
(basically what should or could be done later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be various reasons to add a TODO, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the thing it describes is blocked on some other work (e.g. refactoring)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;currently the author does not have time for this much better approach described in a TODO,
while the current approach is good enough for now, but could be improved later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO accomplishes number of functions, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping the author not to forget to do something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;informing the reader that
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a given bit can be improved&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the author knew about this better way, but for some reason decided not to do it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todos-outside-of-code&quot;&gt;TODOs outside of code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I started using TODOs in my code, I naturally started adding them in other areas of my life as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you do a large enough project (e.g. writing a large blog post or trying to plan
a large event), you have a lot of tasks and can feel overwhelmed. Often there are just
to many of them and some can even pull more further work. As a result, if one is a perfectionist, one can
easily get stuck already at the first task by going too deep into it and producing very little utility
for the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, imagine you are doing some website to test a new idea.
You could setup its backend perfectly, including, for example, plenty of tests, easy one click scalability
and super powerful servers. However, very soon in the process this stops helping much with your original goal -
to test an idea. Perhaps the idea won’t work for some other reasons and all this hard work will be then even wasted.
On the other hand, it can be hard to just say “ok, I will do poor quality work here” and
setup the backend in a poor fashion (especially when one is a perfectionist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here come TODOs (or you could call this “prioritization”, but TODOs sound more exciting). One can accept
that the backend setup could be improved, evaluate the relative benefits and if in doubt just leave a TODO
to do this a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; later (if later ever comes). Basically, instead of saying “I did shitty job here”, one says
“yeap, this is not my best masterpiece, but, hey, I know how to improve it and if it ever becomes a problem,
I will do that”. If later does indeed come, one can reread the list of TODOs and reprioritize them based
on the new state of the world (new knowledge, demand). If later does not come, one has just saved plenty of
time not by doing that TODO. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a funny fact, I have a comment with a TODO right above this line to add a link to a post about
importance of time. The post does not exist yet, but once it does I can search for all TODOs
and replace this one with a link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy productive and well-prioritized work!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">I’ve started using TODOs not only in my code.

but the file was there. This took me some time to figure out and I would like to 
share the issue (a non-obvious stray whitespace in the filename) as well as other ways this could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief-intro&quot;&gt;Brief intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may not know what Jekyll or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_url&lt;/code&gt; is.
Let me briefly explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for creating static html blogs.
Basically you give Jekyll your blog “source code” and Jekyll “compiles” it 
into nicely looking static html blog, which you can then host somewhere (like GitHub pages).
As an example, this blog is done precisely like that - Jekyll + GitHub pages.
Can’t I write plain html myself without any fancy “compiling”? I can, but that’s cumbersome.
I would have to explicitly care about html when writing my posts and also manually add all the 
boilerplate to each page. Instead I just write a text of the post (i.e. the most exciting part of the process) using
special language called markdown and Jekyll does all the remaining boring stuff for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post_url-tag&quot;&gt;post_url tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This markdown language has special commands, which one can use to make writing easier.
This can be something simple like making text &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; or something more
complex like creating a table or adding a link somewhere. These commands are called tags.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_url&lt;/code&gt; is a tag for adding a link to another post in your blog.
Obviously, I could just hardcode a direct link, but &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_url&lt;/code&gt; has couple advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;complains if the link is broken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes the link if something changes (e.g. domain name or post url change)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allows not to think about what the link will actually be and, thus, saves times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happily writing 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lectures-4-5&quot;&gt;a summary for lectures 4-5 of Robert Sapolsky’s course&lt;/a&gt; 
and I wanted to add a link to 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lectures-1-3&quot;&gt;the summary of lectures 1-3&lt;/a&gt;.
So I wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1-3 - Intro &amp;amp; Behavioral Evolution]({% post_url 2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3  %})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the file I just copied. To my sheer surprise this didn’t work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Liquid Exception: Could not find post 
&quot;2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3&quot;
in tag 'post_url'. Make sure the post exists and the name is correct. 
in /blog/source/_posts/2019-03-26-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_4_5.markdown
             ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT:
                    ------------------------------------
                    Could not find post &quot;2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3&quot; 
                    in tag 'post_url'. Make sure the post exists and the name is correct.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After googling for some time, I accidentally noticed that
the filename of the post I was trying to link to had a space right before the extension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                                    this little guy here
                                                                        \
2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3 .markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I copied the filename, the space was copied as well, but Jekyll ignored it, because that’s
how tags work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that Jekyll tags handle spaces inside the file name well, e.g. a file named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019-03-17-human behavioral biology sapolsky course summary lectures_1_3.markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;works perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-possible-causes&quot;&gt;Other possible causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I spent time googling this, let’s collect here other possible causes, which could lead to this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post is not published. This can happen for multiple reasons, e.g.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;explicit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published: false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;published date is from the future (including due to timezone)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;wrong folder (it should be in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the file is missing the date prefix or it is not separated from the rest of the filename with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The post belongs to a collection (use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#link&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt; instead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this does not solve your problem (or you are curious), you might look
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/post_url.rb&quot;&gt;at the source code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(based on their responses to SavingNinja thought experiment #5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-losing-everything&quot;&gt;my response to the previous thought experiment&lt;/a&gt;
I thought
that it would be cool to write an overview of all the responses. Perhaps
there are some patterns and peculiarities. This is my first attempt at this.
Obviously I have no clue where this will go, but I will just start reading
all the responses and then see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please find it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDRC1HheipxzNJWfaS-xhy2aj7NPqLD5ndsu_gRmGMg/preview&quot;&gt;this Google Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions--peculiarities-discovered&quot;&gt;Conclusions / peculiarities discovered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were 2 ways to understand the problem statement. One is to describe
what you will do once you reach FIRE somewhen in future (i.e. after your normal
FIRE date). Another is to assume that you magically reach FIRE today (at least
3 responses did this).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I forgot about some stuff when was writing my post, like reading and languages.
However, this probably just illustrates that these are less important for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One can use this overview to find like minded people,
e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://asimplelifewithsam.com/&quot;&gt;Sam @ A Simple Life&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thefireshrink.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The FIRE Shrink&lt;/a&gt; would both
like to do more gardening once reaching FIRE.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surprisingly, at least 4 responses do include part time work
and only one (&lt;a href=&quot;https://financeyourfire.com/2019/04/15/thought-experiment-fire-now-what/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;Marc @ Finance Your Fire&lt;/a&gt;) says 100% no to work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For some reason, learning French is very popular (at least 3 responses).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only one post was from an already retired author (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youngfiguy.com/retiring-from-retiring/&quot;&gt;Young FI Guy&lt;/a&gt;), I did enjoy their perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure why you would like to read them, but below all the notes I took
while reading the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;savingninja&quot;&gt;SavingNinja&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/what-will-i-do-when-i-retire/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not fired yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people want FI? They want time (like during their childhood).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always wanted to be a game developer, but went to mobile development for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream: having a title on Steam (or Project Stadia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a novel (an epic fantasy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating my own mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building (shed, sawmill, barn, stables, home)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-deed-a-bly&quot;&gt;in-deed-a-bly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indeedably.com/whats-next/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not fired yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describes one project to be done in the nearest future
(next step for personal finance and budgeting software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get an impression that the author assumed that “they have reached FI today,
what would they do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caveman--ditchthecave&quot;&gt;CaveMan @ DitchTheCave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ditchthecave.com/when-i-grow-up/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describes their experiences during Brexit vote day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to the gym multiple times a week (plus possibly some sword fighting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to bed whenever feeling like it, the same for waking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning. French and Spanish. Joining a choir, relearning the piano.
Doing a masters degree in Shakespeare.
Doing this already, but giving more time and attention after FI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteering (conservation works in the countryside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow travel. Spending weeks rather than days, being able to speak the language and culture immersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying 1€ house in Italy. Training at Muay Thai camp in Thailand. Going to India or Bali to become a qualified yoga teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decompressing and understanding real priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears. Absence of motivation to stay fit, family rejection, busy friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-way-to-less&quot;&gt;A Way to Less&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://awaytoless.com/thought-experiment-5/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumption: hitting FI today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably continuing working part time as a transition before the trip to Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Swahili and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sport: training better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending more time with family (e.g. niece) and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength training 3 or 4 times a week instead of 2 now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing learning to do handstand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food - interesting restaurants and trying different cuisines from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing DIY projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the trip, probably quiting work.
Doing another trip, but to South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a family (having a kid).
Full time parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More slow travel.
Spending more time with their partner.
Improve at sports.
Watch sporting events and music.
Play music.
Volunteer.
Building a house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cashflow-cop&quot;&gt;Cashflow Cop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cashflowcop.com/beyond-financial-independence-tracing-my-roots/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream of not being tied to the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of usual “stuff” they could do
(spending time with their wife and kids, traveling, reading, writing, learning to play piano, carpentry, photography, build our forever home, gym, hiking, learning French)
but there is no point to go into this.
Let’s rather consider a project, for which he will have more time and energy once FI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describes his childhood visit back to the country of origin 9 years after leaving for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is to return to the native country, but not for a holiday.
Understand history and culture. Know their relatives better.
Enable children to understand roots and mother-tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charity work in their birth country - helping children to get out of poverty.
Probably introducing financial literacy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their wife is worried, that they will be too busy during FIRE.
Family is the highest priority, especially after FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merely-curious&quot;&gt;Merely curious&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://merelycurious.me/post/thought-experiment-projects-when-fire&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No precise projects, since plenty of time before FIRE to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming, data analysis, making websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing projects differently - sprinting (focusing on one project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects are defined very broadly (a finite chunk of work with a title).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derailing into how to collect ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing more in the blog, including posts requiring more time.
Art (juggling with humor, learning to draw, playing music and composing).
DIY - sewing. 
Cooking - more unusual and time consuming dishes, including for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggests to upscale current lifestyle in FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably stand up comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sport (everyday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubt whether answered Saving Ninja question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving short term examples (FIRE game, making rain-stick, FIRE calculator).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sam--a-simple-life&quot;&gt;Sam @ A Simple Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asimplelifewithsam.com/2019/04/15/ninja-thought-experiment-5/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioning MMM advice to see what you are doing on weekends these days
and to expand it to the full week once FI. MMM suggests to think in terms of
the following categories: outdoors, social, physical, generous and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time for garden. Growing vegetables all year round.
Selling some produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being much more active member of existing social groups in the village.
Posting more on Twitter and other social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking more. Cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More direct charity helping work (once a week or once a fortnight).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning French and Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubt whether answered Saving Ninja question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving advice to the readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying art and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel, trying new things, have friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIY,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t ask me exactly what I want to do – I haven’t a clue!
But it will be fun whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;

Which projects would you?
This is the new shiny thought experiment by SavingNinja. And I have a lot to do, indeed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to my response, let me introduce the concept, so that you understand all the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/category/thought-experiments/&quot;&gt;“Thought experiments”&lt;/a&gt;
is a project by SavingNinja. The idea is that some hypothetical situation is posted every 2 months
and participants must write down their thoughts without any preparation or major editing.
This should uncover their inner views and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took part last time and the topic was “If You Lost Everything” (&lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-losing-everything&quot;&gt;my response&lt;/a&gt;).
Without doubt it was much darker, but nevertheless interesting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projects-after-fire-thought-experiment&quot;&gt;“Projects after FIRE” thought experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment’s page is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/what-will-i-do-when-i-retire&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
(it also contains links to other bloggers’ posts)
and the “problem” statement is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life is good. You finally did it! You pulled the plug on your day job after reaching financial independence. 
You never have to work for money ever again. But, you’re bored. You need something to do… You need a project! 
You grab a piece of paper and a pen and start thinking. Now that you’re financially free,
what projects do you want to complete? However ambitious, however small,
you now have the time to pursue anything that you like, what will you accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPD Apr 20, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;: FYI, I’ve prepared an &lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-overview-projects-when-fire&quot;&gt;the overview of other participant responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-reply&quot;&gt;My reply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-reading-the-new-experiment&quot;&gt;Before reading the new experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I am doing the writing in the morning to avoid any scary dreams during the night
(I didn’t have any last time, but just in case).
Let’s see what Savings Ninja prepared for us.
In his tweet he wrote that not everyone will be able to “partake” in this one, so I am curious why.
My guesses are that this could be related to gender (but this would be weird) or perhaps FIRE status
(e.g. a question to already FIRE’d people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after-reading-the-new-experiment&quot;&gt;After reading the new experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, this one seems pretty easy.
Basically what I want to do (focusing more on projects side) once I “retire”.
Obviously, I can’t tell precise projects, because I may accomplish some of them before FIRE,
however, I can definitely try to explain the general theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I have plenty of random ideas for projects already today.
These are mostly related to programming, data analysis and making websites.
I would definitely spend more time on these. However, currently almost all of them tend to have some 
money making part and this could go away once I FIRE. I can’t say that I explicitly filter my projects
to make money (I don’t drop ideas, which are unlikely to make money), but I get majority of ideas
like that anyway. So it is probably something inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would probably try doing my projects differently once I FIRE. Currently there is always not enough time
and I can spend only small portion of my time on my projects. As a result they all take multiple weeks.
I would definitely try doing sprinting more (e.g. one week or even entire month for one project full time).
Not sure whether this would work perfectly, because I may then get bored, I like to have many ongoing things at once
and jump back and forth between projects, which interest me the most. However, trying won’t hurt me and having a reasonably
finished project in a reasonable time might feel pleasant too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably should explain more what I mean by projects. As I said, there is not much point
to talk about specific ideas, since I will probably address majority of items on my list
before FIRE. However, by projects I don’t mean something large. It can be pretty small.
I also don’t have any specific limitations for my projects. If it looks like a finite chunk of work
not related to other things I am doing and for which I can define an actionable target
and a title, this is already a project in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually have multiple lists in my life, because ideas (sometimes even good) come randomly,
so I try to make it as easy as possible to record them and whenever there is any urgent need,
I don’t have to come up with ideas, but just check my list. In some sense, I precache my ideas
for some topics to save time later when there is a need for that topic. I should write a post
about this (I can call it “Catching ideas”). Here are couple of ideas for the post, so that I
don’t forget: I suspect that the rate with which ideas appear is constant (assuming that you 
don’t have major lifestyle changes). Thus, one should optimize how easy it is to record them
and time for how long one collects them. It is similar to having a net and just catching some
fruits falling from a tree. It is important to write even “bad” ideas, the first impression may be wrong,
deleting an idea later is easy, you may learn something new later, which will change your perspective.
For me ideas usually come as a reaction to something I saw or read. Occasionally this can be a
combination of multiple sources. You actually saw above how I got an idea for the new post. 
Now I have added this to my internal list of ideas for blog posts. As you might have noticed I have
&lt;a href=&quot;/queue/&quot;&gt;a public list of ideas for blog posts&lt;/a&gt; 
as well. Actually I think I have too many blog post ideas and not
enough free time for all of them. As a result, I publish some of them just as ideas (I should definitely publish a new batch)
and then see which ones people visit the most. This helps me to prioritize. Having too many ideas 
(or in other words choosing which ones to pursue) is the next problem you have pretty quickly
once you develop a good idea “catching” approach. You could say that I could choose the ones I like the most,
the issue is that I like almost all of them :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I got derailed badly. Sorry, sorry. Regarding projects, even a larger blog post requiring 
some research is a project. It has an actionable goal - write a blog post about X - and a title e.g. “blogpost X”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t think I would be able to work full-time on my projects, because it is pretty demanding work.
I can’t be sure, but I suspect that I won’t. E.g. currently on weekends I rarely have 8 hours of 
clean “project” work. I definitely won’t force myself, because then I will just hate all my projects and that’s
not my goal. As a result, I would likely do something else in addition to projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense I may now derail into general “life after FIRE” instead of “projects after FIRE”, but the term “project”
is very broad for me, so it is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely write more in my blog. Probably even somewhat weirder blog posts, which currently I filter out
because it feels like I am the only one interested, but then I could give a try to a couple. I think I would do
more blog posts requiring more background work. Currently, when I have not that much free time, spending entire week
on one blog post feels wasteful. Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I would try to develop artistic part of me more. Currently, this feels like it is not worth it, because this is
mostly just for myself, but I definitely feel desire to try. One way would be to improve my juggling skills and then
start juggling for other people entertainment. I enjoy combination of juggling and humor very much and I think that
juggling provides a lot of opportunities (failing can be fun) and I would try to develop some small act of mine
involving juggling and trying to be funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also interested to learn how to draw. However, I am extremely bad at this right now and it feels like this will take
me eternity. So for now it is again not worth it, but when I have more free time I would try for sure. Another similar
area is music (playing music instruments and composing). Here I am probably even worse than with drawing. I would be
interested to moderately develop my skills. Perhaps I am just curious whether I just don’t have ability (which I don’t
believe, but this could be the first example) or just didn’t spend enough time practicing effectively. Currently both drawing
and music look like magic to me. Moving something from “magic” to normal life is a wonderful feeling, which I greatly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I could do more DIY, e.g. currently sewing interests me as another medium of expression. Making a couple clothing items
looks interesting. Probably now you understand the name of my blog. When I see my lists of things I could do I occasionally
get a feeling that I may be even too curious sometimes. I hope that this does not harm me, but prioritization is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, also cooking. I enjoy cooking. I feel like the result is often multiple times better than the effort involved.
I also like to cook kinds of food, which normally everyone just buys and few people think how to cook it from scratch.
Sometimes cooking such food is extremely
easy, so I end up cooking it every now and then even though everyone else just buys it. One example is bread. After
some practice, baking bread becomes extremely simple and fast (in terms of active time spent - not waiting). After FIRE
I would cook unusual and more time consuming dishes more often. Perhaps even I would cook for other people. 
Currently I often cook something quick, because again - time. I extremely rarely cook for other people these days, but this is
a very important part of cooking in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, ok, this is much longer text than I originally expected. It also didn’t go that easy at the beginning, but now
I completely missed how I wrote that much. I feel a bit weird, because Savings Ninja might have meant more
concrete project ideas here, but my concrete planning horizon is not that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also why would I actually wait until FIRE to do something? It becomes apparent from the text above that I will be doing either
more of or just more intensively stuff I am doing right now. I think that this is how it should be, because you should live a good
life now and not somewhen in future. So if I had some super interesting project, I don’t think I would ever say “oh, cool, let’s wait
until FIRE to do it”. Ok, in some sense I am doing this for my artsy ideas (e.g. juggling with humor), but I juggle these
days as well. So again I will be doing something similar, but in a more time consuming manner after FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way stand-up comedy interests me as well, but probably not as much as stuff above since I remembered about it only
now. But I can imagine giving it a try. I would also experiment more with my life and try new things for sure .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would do sport more often (like everyday). This is hard to call a project, but I would love to do more sport
and currently (again) have not much time for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To calm down my inner self, I can give you a couple of things I am working right now, which you can use as a basis to extrapolate
what I will be doing after FIRE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;larger projects:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I am making a FIRE game (it is in some sense a simulator of life with FIRE related bits). This is a very early stage, so
nothing to show yet. I will definitely make a post about it and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/merely_curious_&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I saw an interesting African music instrument in a museum (known as rain-stick) and now I would like to reproduce it at home. 
The original one used some plant parts, which I am going to replace with pistachio shells. Currently I am at “collecting
pistachio shells” stage. Since I don’t eat pistachio that often (even though I avoid expensive 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/crazy-pistachio&quot;&gt;“crazy pistachio”&lt;/a&gt;
I saw recently, they are still pricey enough to be enjoyed moderately), this takes time. This is also an example of a project, which is interesting, but does not have that much of a practical benefit. I should make a blog post about this as well.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/pages/calculator.html&quot;&gt;FIRE calculator&lt;/a&gt; which tells how saving or spending X euro affects your FIRE date
(i.e. how many days sooner or later it will be).
I made a rough prototype, but then I got busy with other projects and now this one waits for its golden time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for blog posts you can have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;/queue/&quot;&gt;my public post idea list&lt;/a&gt;.
Every view counts and affects what I will write about next, so
thank you a lot for your help! As I said, prioritization is hard and you help me enormously by somewhat implicitly expressing your interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and thank you a lot, Savings Ninja, for making me think and even write about all of these. Everyone should do this occasionally,
even people not interested in FIRE. FIRE definitely promotes such thinking and makes “what I want to do with my life” question
much more burning, since you can get more freedom to actually do something with your life. I am pretty sure that my views will
somewhat change by the time I reach FIRE, I don’t think that this will be a major change, but definitely polishing of some details.
I also claim that answering this question can be a game changer for FIRE. I don’t have practical
experience, but I suspect that if you go into FIRE without clear understand what you enjoy and want to do, the free time you will
have will be like a punishment for you. It will be just boring, because there won’t be anything really interesting to do.
So it is better to start thinking about this earlier or even building some version of the life you want already before FIRE 
and then just upscaling this life. I hope that my approach (having a lot of time shortage now and just satisfying this demand
in FIRE) will work. What is also funny, that I have never noticed before that I implicitly cut so many activities due to time shortage.
Without an overview in one place, I noticed that I stopped myself sometimes from doing something time-consuming,
but this felt like rather rare incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now extremely curious why not everyone may be able to partake in this experiment? Did Saving Ninja mean people who are not
trying to reach FIRE? But they probably won’t read his blog that much. Hm. Something is weird here. I should ask him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I forgot, after the last thought experiment, I thought that it would be cool to compare responses of other people (i.e. 
categorize them and make a table with an overview). This time I am going to do this. Unfortunately, I can’t do this now,
because there is nothing to read yet, so I will have to wait until people start publishing. So if you are curious
to get a general overview, come back in couple days (or perhaps a week to be sure), I will post a link here (and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/merely_curious_&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; as well).
This must be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

This made me think that I’ve been paying more for the first class apples without explicitly realizing this.
Let’s see why this is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a “weekly” discount for apples (1 euro for 2 kilos) in Edeka.
I discovered this in their “prospekt” (I wrote about supermarket discounts 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/weekly-discounts-in-german-supermarkets&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
However, once I bought them (actually 6 kilograms), I discovered that they were
“the second class”. Obviously, they did not look terribly bad, otherwise I would have
noticed this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home I had a more careful look. Indeed there was something unusual with 90% of apples.
They had small damages or imperfections (at most 1 cm^2 in area, but most of them even much smaller than that).
In my life I definitely have seen and even eaten apples, which were in a much worse condition (I can clearly
remember an apple, which was in such a bad state, that I had to cut out almost half of it, but I ate the rest).
If you compare these second class apples to what I had before, they are then rather 99%
perfect. Here you basically cut out one very small piece and you get a perfectly fine apple.
Obviously, you probably can’t store them as long as the first class apples, but I bought only 6 kilograms
(not a tonne).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me this uncovered an interesting issue. Such second class apples is a pretty rare guest in the supermarkets.
I have seen apples for “processing” (Verarbeitung) before, these had no damages, but mostly weird shape instead.
As far as I understood, they were meant for juicing. Obviously I also bought and ate them (and they were just fine).
Apart from that all apples I observed in supermarkets are the first class (i.e. ideal shape and state).
This is probably the first time I explicitly saw second class apples being sold. 
However, when I buy the first class apples, I actually pay premium for them to be the first class.
Since I haven’t thought about this before and never even had a choice, I was doing this implicitly.
And as I learned after buying the second class apples, paying this premium actually makes no sense to me.
I am as happy to consume second class apples as the first class. Basically, someone has made this decision
not to bring second class apples to the market that often and now all buyers are paying more for their
apples to be ideal (due to absence of choice), but without realizing and enjoying this. 
I consider this premium a waste of money from buyer perspective, since without having a reference point
(a concept which I learned during “Science of Wellbeing” course, my summary is 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
of second class apples, they can’t enjoy how the first class apples are better than the second.
For them, these are just normal average boring apples, not “not a second class” apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am definitely curious which other premiums I’ve been paying for without realizing.
Unfortunately, identifying them is extremely tricky (unless you accidentally stumble on a product
without this premium feature like these second class apples), so I couldn’t come up with anything yet, but I am
now very vigilant. Perhaps you have encountered some other examples already?&lt;/p&gt;

Lecture 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-6-behavioral-genetics-i&quot;&gt;Lecture 6: Behavioral Genetics I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how the methodology for studying genetic component of behavior changed with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;species&quot;&gt;Species&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the field started, people assumed that &lt;del&gt;if a trait is universal in a species, it must be genetic&lt;/del&gt;.
This is very limited approach, which works for flies, but does not for more complex organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;families&quot;&gt;Families&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to consider families. The closer related two individuals are, the more genes they share.
If you have a behavioral trait that becomes more common the more closely related two individuals are,
it must have genetic component. However, the more related two individuals are, the more they share their environment
as well. Thus, with this approach one cannot distinguish genetic component of behavior from environmental influence.
This was a classic approach 70-80 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;twins&quot;&gt;Twins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then let’s control for environment. Examine relatives in the same environment, but having different genes.
For example, one can consider identical (monozygotic) twins (sharing 100% genes) vs fraternal (dizygotic) twins
(sharing 50% genes). If they all live in the same environment and fraternal twins differ in some way, while
identical twins don’t - this must have genetic basis. Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes fraternal twins have different sex -&amp;gt; let’s restrict to same sex fraternal twins.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These twins are still treated differently as pairs. As a result, there is more environment differentiation for fraternal twins.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identical twins can have one or two placentas (based on when the split happened - before or after 5 days since fertilization).
In one placenta case, they have same blood flow. With two placentas - there can be differences in blood flow.
As a result, in one placenta case they have much more similar environment.
For example, they are more likely to have similar IQ when having one placenta (when compared to two placenta case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-sexes&quot;&gt;Different sexes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we have everything exactly the same except sex? Does not work either.
1 hour old boys have more arm movement than girls. However, moms already (from the first time 
they hold the child) treat them differently (holding for different duration of time and in different proximity to
their face).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sat-scores-and-gender-study&quot;&gt;SAT scores and gender study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One loud example of this is a study about 13 year old pupils’ SAT scores in math.
In particular, how they depend on sex. The results were that more boys had higher scores.
The paper was published in Nature and concluded that since they had the same lessons
(there was no school curriculum differentiation yet at that age), this must be a biological difference.
Press quickly called this “the math gene” and it was claimed that boys tended to have it more often.
However, there were differences in their environment. Other studies has shown that even in the first grade
a boy is more likely to be called when raising his hand for a math problem. Boys are also more likely
to be praised for correct answers in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adoption-studies&quot;&gt;Adoption studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at individuals raised in the same environment, but with different genes (adoption studies).
Consider someone who was adopted as a child. Who are they more likely to share a trait with -
biological parents or adoptive? In animals this can be done by cross-fostering,
i.e. switching newborns (or only 50% of them) across mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biological-component-of-schizophrenia&quot;&gt;Biological component of schizophrenia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seymour Kety tried to test whether schizophrenia has biologic component
(The significance of genetic factors in the etiology of schizophrenia: Results from the national study of adoptees in Denmark, 1987). 
The study considered adopted individuals who had schizophrenia. Are they more likely to share this trait with their
biological or adoptive parents? Entire database of adoptees in Denmark was researched (Scandinavian countries
record a lot of data). In general population probability to develop schizophrenia is 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probability to develop schizophrenia based on whether biological/adoptive parents have schizophrenia.
Numbers are from the course. The original source: Seymour Kety,
“The significance of genetic factors in the etiology of schizophrenia: Results from the national study of adoptees in Denmark”, 1987&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;no schizophrenia&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;adoptive&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;no schizophrenia&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, having biological parent with schizophrenia increases probability, having both (biological and adoptive) - increases it even further
(non-additive synergisms). This was the first study to show heritable basis for a psychiatric disorder. This became a gold standard for
behavioral genetics studies. People started applying this approach to depression, alcoholism, criminal behavior. They observed similar
results. Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the adoption does not happen immediately after the birth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prenatal environment shared with mom (this can be measured by difference of probability to share a trait with mom and dad).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paternity uncertainty - sometimes a person claiming to be a father is not a father.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adoptive family placements are not random (in some countries like US kids are matched across a lot of domains before adoption).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;identical-twins-separated-at-birth&quot;&gt;Identical twins separated at birth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best approach so far is to consider identical twins separated at birth (they can be adopted in different households).
This uncovers 50% heritability of IQ, position on introvert-extrovert scale, degree of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem: non-random placements. To mitigate, compare similarities between monozygotic and dizygotic twins (they both have non-random
placement), but this makes the sample size small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-at-non-learned-traits&quot;&gt;Looking at non-learned traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we consider traits which happen without learning? 
E.g. smiling (even blind babies smile), beginning to babble at the same age
(even for deaf babies). Random observation - even fetuses smile during third trimester.
Prenatal effects can affect such traits too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;environment-begins-earlier-than-birth&quot;&gt;Environment begins earlier than birth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider some ways which can affect the child before birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sharing-blood-with-mom&quot;&gt;Sharing blood with mom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hormones&quot;&gt;Hormones&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rats have dozen of fetuses which have more similar blood environment with adjacent sibling fetuses.
As a result, the more male siblings a rat fetus has adjacent to them, the later it will reach puberty 
(local endocrine effects).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Children born to younger or older mothers reach puberty later (due to lower estrogen levels in mothers).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stress in mother propagates to fetus through stress hormones. In rats this causes smaller brain in adulthood,
thinner cortex, less learning abilities, more prone towards anxiety, stronger cognitive decline in old age.
This also decreases brain region responsible for dealing with stress hormones. As a result such offsprings 
have more stress hormones themselves. Their offsprings will be affected even more by this. This environmental effect
can be observed even in grand children (“the grandmother effect”). I.e. this is inheriting of a non-genetic trait
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;non-Mendelian inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nutrients&quot;&gt;Nutrients.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_famine_of_1944%E2%80%9345&quot;&gt;Dutch Hunger Winter&lt;/a&gt; - almost immediate decline in available
food due to war in winter 1944.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third trimester fetuses learn how many calories are available in the world during a specific time period.
They “study” nutritional profile. Then based on the results they can “choose” how their body should function through metabolic programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Individuals who were third trimester fetuses during Dutch Hunger Winter (i.e. built their nutritional profile during the famine) were
trying to store as much nutrients as possible and their kidneys tried to store more salt as well.
When normal diet returned (also almost immediate change) - affected individuals showed 19x increase in incidents of obesity,
diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome. This is a very dramatic difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This did not happen to newborns or first trimester fetuses. This is now studied as part of “fetal origins of adult diseases”.
E.g. stress hormones during fetal life cause higher anxiety in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;People in Stalingrad didn’t get this effect, because there the food decrease was steady.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What happens when people affected get pregnant themselves? Their bodies take too much calories from blood,
and as a result fetus is born with mild version of “Dutch Hunger Winter” phenomenon (again non-Mendelian inheritance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Females (including in humans) can consume different amounts of estrogen (E.g. vitoestrogen from plants).
When consumed more - fetus has consistent increase in estrogen dependent breast cancer in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;learning&quot;&gt;Learning.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In rats one can inject sucrose water with particular taste (fetuses drink amniotic fluid).
 After birth this taste will be preferred when given a choice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mom’s voice in humans. Fetuses hear a lot, but especially moms voice. 
When reading “Cat in hat” a lot out loud vs random collection of sentences (controlled for length and rhytmicity),
newborns prefer “Cat in hat” (they make sucking motion when they like something). When fathers read, this does not work
anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;. Environment does not being at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember strains of rats with different levels of anxiety mentioned in previous lectures? There was “an adoption” study,
where fetuses were transfered during pregnancy. As a result, it was not a genetic trait, but a prenatal effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genetic-influence-from-mother&quot;&gt;Genetic influence from mother&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see more shared traits with mother than with father, these can be attributed to prenatal effects.
However, one gets more genetic influence from mother, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when father is not real father&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mitochondria has its own DNA. Sperm does not carry mitochondria, but only DNA. As a result, one inherits all their
mitochondria DNA from mother.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;imprinted genes - work differently based on whom they come from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sperm does not have transcription factors. All transcription factors in a fertilized egg are from mother.
Imagine there is a transcription factor A and it is needed to produce more of A and to activate gene X.
If due to an environmental change, A stops being produced, there will be no A in the egg and
this will disable X for offsprings forever (i.e. genes are inherited, but won’t be expressed due to acquired trait in mother - lamarckian traits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indirect-genetic-effects&quot;&gt;Indirect genetic effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can also be indirect genetic effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider 50% heritability of your position on introvert-extrovert scale.
This conclusion held through all the concerns above.
However, height and appearance are highly inheritable.
Taller people are treated better and considered more attractive.
People treated more positively during childhood become more extroverted. Most of introvert-extrovert heritability
is mediated by heritability of physical traits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heritability of rank in turkeys - actually it is due to the color of their feathers, which is inherited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chicks are able to peck for grabs very early. However, newborn chicks have heritable tendency to find their toes very
interesting, as a result they peck at their toes and learn to do proper pecking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;70% heritability of political party affiliation in US. Mediating variable - how people feel about ambiguity. Conservatives
are more ambiguity averse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rats and mouse strains with various levels of aggression. Mediation: aggressive strains have lower threshold for pain sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;epigenetic-effects&quot;&gt;Epigenetic effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA cover can block transcription factors from reaching DNA permanently.
This happened in Dutch Hunger Winter people. 
Another example: pet newborn rat for 3 min/day for 2 weeks after it is born -&amp;gt; larger brain, better learning.
Pet it for 1.5 hours/day instead -&amp;gt; smaller brain, shorter life expectancy.
It is interesting what counts as stimulation (3 min) vs stress (1.5 hours). However, this actually changes mother behavior.
3 min petting causes mom to get excited and to lick and groom the kid more. 1.5 hours causes ignorance for long period of time.
Petting itself does not matter, but only mother reaction.
Licking and grooming by mother causes larger brain and all other possible outcomes mentioned above. 
This can have multi-generational effect - licked and groomed daughters will lick and groom their kids more (
again non-Mendelian inheritance). This changes access of transcription factors, which are related to activating genes for making receptors for
stress hormones. It is also reversible. Cross-fostering after non-grooming mom improves kids state.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Continuing watching and writing a summary for Robert Sapolsky’s course “Human Behavioral Biology”.

Here is my impression (pretty mixed and rather on the negative side) and summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book felt weird and very wordy. Basically the author developed their own theory about what makes one to like their job
and how to reach this state. These ideas seemed reasonable and somewhat obvious. However, there was no attempt to prove anything
any only ~10 anecdotes instead, which do illustrate the point, but does not prove it. One could easily ignore all the anecdotes.
Also closer to the end the book started listing somewhat random advice from other books. Overall, the content could have been compressed 10-20x without losing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 2/5 (this wasn’t a complete waste of time, but quite wasteful, I can’t recommend this book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-your-passion-is-harmful&quot;&gt;“Follow your passion” is harmful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are used to hear “follow your passion” advice from everywhere as a way to choose your career.
However, this is wrong. Even Steve Jobs said the same advice, but his own story was different.
If he had followed his passion, there would have been no Apple. Do what Steve Jobs did, not what he 
said to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Follow your passion” has been started with a book “What Color is Your Parachute?” by Bolles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion advice is dangerous, because it makes you feel that there is a perfect job and that
you will immediately recognize it. This leads to excessive career hoping and unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-job&quot;&gt;Great job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self Determination Theory explains intrinsic work motivation needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autonomy - control over your day and feeling that your actions are important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competence - feeling that you are good at what you are doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relatedness - feeling connection to other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a great work requires creativity, impact and control. 
Jobs with these features are rare and valuable. As a result, due to supply &amp;amp; demand
you have to provide something rare and valuable in return (e.g. good skills).
The author calls such skills “career capital”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mindsets-passion-vs-craftsmanship&quot;&gt;Mindsets: passion vs craftsmanship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to passion mindset (focusing on what a job offers you), there is craftsmanship mindset
(focusing on what you produce).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the passion mindset - answering “do I really love this?” and “what do I like?” is nearly impossible and leads to unhappiness.
Also this forces you to focus on what you don’t like, but all entry level jobs are not perfect (low autonomy and few challenges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion mindset claims that you need only courage to start your dream job, which will have creativity, impact and autonomy.
Craftsmanship mindset requires you to build your skills first (“to be come so good they can’t ignore you”) to earn
creativity, impact and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some jobs are just not good for craftsmanship mindset. The job is like that if it has any of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one cannot build skill in it to distinguish themselves from others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one finds the results they produce useless or even harmful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one is forced to work with people they don’t like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deliberate-practice&quot;&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are some guitar players not that good, while others are much better even after the same amount of practice?
They’ve practiced differently. If you don’t get out of your comfort level during practice, you won’t develop your
skill that well. Instead you should do deliberate practice - focus on what you do badly and use immediate feedback
to correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps to do deliberate practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the career capital market you are in - winner-takes-all or an auction
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Winner-takes-all - only one skill matters and everyone competes for it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Auction - many skills are important, everyone can propose a combination of skills.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify which career capital you need to pursue (i.e. which skill or skills).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define “good”, i.e. your feedback criteria and clear goals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Stretch”. Practice outside of your comfort zone and accept feedback even if it
disagrees with your feelings. You may think that what you did is perfect, but you may
be not the one deciding in the end and then your opinion won’t matter at all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be patient - improving takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use open gates - some opportunities which you happened to have e.g. by chance - to gain
career capital much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaining-control-at-work&quot;&gt;Gaining control at work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving people control over what and how they do increases their happiness, satisfactions and
fulfillment. Once you have career capital you can use it to gain control in your work.
Gaining control before you have enough career capital is dangerous. I.e. you can start doing
what you really want, but no one will find it valuable (e.g. a startup, which no one finds
interesting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have enough career capital to pursue more control (i.e. become valuable enough),
your current employer will try to prevent you from gaining this control, because
this has negative impact for them (less control of you, possibility to lose you). They would
rather use your career capital further and on the old terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, courage is important to face this resistance. However, you should be valuable enough as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-law-of-financial-viability&quot;&gt;The Law of Financial Viability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to identify whether you have enough career capital to go for more control?
If you have an idea how to gain more control, seek evidence whether people are willing to pay you
for it. If yes, proceed. Otherwise move on.
“Willing to pay” may have different meaning, e.g. they actually pay you or you get a loan or you get hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Do what people are willing to pay for” Derek Sivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless people are ready to pay you for an idea, it is not an idea you should go after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mission&quot;&gt;Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building career on some mission can make it more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Adjacent possible” - a set of discoveries that are possible to make from the current state of science.
E.g. discovering oxygen required precise weight scales and thinking about air as something not void.
These 2 inventions moved “oxygen discovery” into “adjacent possible”. This concept is considered 
in greater detail in “Where Good Ideas Come From” by Steven Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore “adjacent possible” one has to reach the cutting edge. Finding a career mission is like
a scientific breakthrough. Reaching the cutting edge is equivalent to building career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going for one large bold idea, one should do small incremental “little bets”, which will
mostly fail and only sometimes succeed. This way one can gather feedback. Each bet should take 
approximately 2 months and be either successful or fail. Each bet should follow your mission idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career capital helps to identify a good mission, little bets help to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;law-of-remarkability&quot;&gt;Law of remarkability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission driven projects need to be remarkable. People who encounter them should want to
“remark” about it, i.e. share. Projects should also be launched in a venue which 
supports such remarks (i.e. allows and promotes sharing). “Purple Cow” by Seth Godin
talks about this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="book" /><category term="summary" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">I’ve read “So Good They Can’t Ignore You” by Cal Newport.

of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being&quot;&gt;&quot;The science of wellbeing&quot;&lt;/a&gt; course at Coursera happened to be much larger than
I originally expected. Here is a more concise one, so that one can quickly refresh all important details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;important-warning-disclaimer&quot;&gt;Important-warning-disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is my very brief summary of the course. If you are considering taking the course,
don’t read this summary. This will spoil all the fun for you. Just go ahead and do the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t consider taking the course, please think again. It is really an amazing course and both of my
summaries probably miss a lot of details. You will get much more by going through the course
(it is only ~19 hours) and doing all the revirements and seeing all the research. Please do the course,
you will like it and understand what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summary is also too brief to make sense on its own. This is rather a cheat-sheet for people who
took the entire course. Taking the course (or at least reading 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;my larger summary&lt;/a&gt;)
would explain a lot of the items below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now let’s get started with a brief summary. Reading through everything in 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;my “large” summary&lt;/a&gt;
is possible, but takes a lot of time. Thus, I would like to summarize my summary even more and write
something short, which I could quickly reread when I feel like I started to forget the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-are-wrong&quot;&gt;We are wrong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that having a good job, high salary, money, awesome stuff, true love, a perfect face/body or good grades will make us happy.
Actually we miswant these (i.e. are mistaken about how much we will like something in the future),
because of annoying features of our minds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our mind strongest intuitions are often totally wrong&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We judge everything relative to (often irrelevant) reference points (e.g. other people or what we had before)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hedonic adaptation - our minds are built to get used to stuff (both positive and negative)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We don’t know about this adaptation and overestimate effects of negative and positive changes in our lives
(due to focalism and immune neglect). You will be fine if you fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prefer (non-material) experiences to physical stuff.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Anticipate them&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talk about them with others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Savour - step outside of an experience to review and appreciate it fully while it is still happening.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Laugh, giggle, express energy physically (jumping, yelling)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Think how lucky and proud you are&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Don’t &lt;del&gt;think about future&lt;/del&gt;, don’t &lt;del&gt;remind yourself that experience will be over or could be better or
 will never be so good again&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Express gratitude
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tell other people if you are grateful to them&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once a week write 5 items from the last week, which you are grateful for (take time to feel it through)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reset your reference points
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After a positive change, re-experience your previous state (either remember or find a real example)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Curate information which you let into your life (e.g. no social media, no TV)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Interrupt your consumption - split awesome things you love (and vice versa - squish all bad things together to use 
 hedonic adaptation)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Increase variety and choose proper timing (don’t eat an ice cream 40 seconds after the previous one)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want right things
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Employing signature strengths in your career&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Getting into “flow” both at work and at leisure&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Growth mindset (“I can grow through hard work”) instead of fixed (&lt;del&gt;“talent is fixed”&lt;/del&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Intrinsic motivation (doing something due to enjoying the activity itself) instead of extrinsic (due to external rewards)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opportunities to do acts of kindness (even small, even to random people)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Social connections (even talking to strangers)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Time affluence (feeling of having enough time to do things you actually want)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Controlling your mind (i.e. decreasing mind-wandering through meditation)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enough sleep (and of good quality)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-implement&quot;&gt;How to implement?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just knowing is not sufficient. Strategies for better habits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Situation support (fix bad environments, promote healthy environments)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set specific goals (e.g. quantitative). Specificity gives you a plan how to achieve the goal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visualize goals: positive outcome followed by possible obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation intention through “if then” plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3 can be combined into WOOP method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about your (optionally the most important for now) wish (as specific as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Its best outcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potential obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your if/then plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This links the obstacle to the wish together with instruments to overcome it and helps to recognize existence of the obstacle&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><category term="summary" /><summary type="html">My summary of &quot;The science of wellbeing&quot; course at Coursera happened to be much larger than I originally expected.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-4-molecular-genetics-i&quot;&gt;Lecture 4: Molecular genetics I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dna&quot;&gt;DNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is a sequence of amino acids.
DNA encodes amino acid.
A sequence of DNA can encode sequence of amino acids, i.e. a protein.
Actually genes (DNA) specify the intermediate form - RNA.
Sequence of genes defines everything else - DNA, RNA, amino acids, protein and its shape.
Protein function is defined by its shape (analogy - protein reception is a lock and protein is its key).
There are 20 amino acids. All of them have different degrees of being attracted or repelled by water.
This relationship with watter defines which shape a string of amino acids (i.e. protein) will have in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enzymes catalyze reactions. For our purposes they can take 2 things and stick them together or take one thing and break it
apart. Virtually every enzyme is a protein. Protein structure also defines circumstances when
its shape can change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central dogma of life (information flow): &lt;del&gt;DNA -&amp;gt; RNA -&amp;gt; protein&lt;/del&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterexamples to the first claim that everything starts with DNA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;viruses which hijack DNA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RNA viruses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;enzymes which can convert RNA back to DNA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mutations&quot;&gt;Mutations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micromutation - one letter random change in DNA.
Each amino acid is encoded by 3 base pairs (a triplet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single letter mutations can be categorized by their effect as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no effect. There are 4^3 = 64 ways to encode amino acids and only 20 amino acids. The genetic code is redundant.
Thus, the letter change can have no effect on resulting sequence of amino acids. Usually, the middle base pair in amino acid is
less important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;weak effect. Some mutations can change resulting amino acid, but some amino acids are similar, so this may not
change the shape of the protein much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;major consequences. Some mutations can change the protein function dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to single letter mutation, there are single point mutations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deletion. This creates a frame shift and totally changes entire sequence of amino acids.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;insertion (e.g. accidental copy). This makes a frame shift in other direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutations change how well a protein does its job (i.e. its efficacy) by changing its shape.
Soma changes are minor, i.e. the protein mostly does it function, but a little bit less efficiently
(i.e. the key still fits the lock, but not ideally anymore). This is a microevolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some changes can be major like knocking the protein completely out of its old business,
which can have dramatic effects overall, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is a chemical called phenylalanine, which can cause harm if there is too much of it.
There is an enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase which converts it into something safer, if this enzyme malfunctions,
this can have extreme effects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria&quot;&gt;Phenylketonuria disorder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;testicular feminization syndrome (male looks like completely healthy but infertile female)
caused by mutation in testosterone receptor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;problems with enzymes producing testosterone. 
Mutation changes testosterone production efficiency.
There is not enough testosterone in the childhood and the individual develops as female.
During puberty the level reaches critical threshold and one changes sex.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mutation can change how benzodiazepines interact with their receptors.
This variability explains individual differences in levels of anxiety.
For example, people are breading rats prone to some behavior - alcoholism, smart, high or low anxiety.
The last two breeds differ by shape of their benzodiazepine receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foxp2 gene is related to communication. Its mutation can cause language problems in humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-dna-is-compared&quot;&gt;How DNA is compared&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you share 50% of DNA with your sibling, but 98% with chimpanzee? Genes specify traits.
E.g. we have genes for specific shape of pelvis. Chimps have them too,
but apple trees don’t. 98% of our and chimp genes encode similar traits (like some shape of pelvis).
Each gene can vary. Thus, when talking about your sibling, the question is not
whether you both have genes for pelvis, but whether they are exactly the same (i.e. same shape of pelvis).
Overall, when we compare across species, we take into account only types of genes encoding
types of traits. Inside one species - different versions of a particular gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gradualism-vs-punctuated-equilibrium&quot;&gt;Gradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 1980s everyone believed in gradualism, 
i.e. that &lt;del&gt;evolution was driven by gradual changes&lt;/del&gt;.
In 1980s a new model called “punctuated equilibrium” emerged. Here periods of stasis (no change) are followed
by very fast and explosive periods of change. It was proposed by a paleontologist.
Consequence of this theory - little changes don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paleontology is different from evolutionary biology.
The timescales are very different (100k years is nothing in paleontology and a lot in biology).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolution of brain, eye color, skin will leave no paleontological record.
Paleontology is about shapes (morphology).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980s non-gradualists (supporters of punctuated equilibrium) struggled to show molecular mechanisms
which could explain punctuated equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dna-structure&quot;&gt;DNA structure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially people thought that DNA had the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;gene A&amp;gt;&amp;lt;stop signal&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene B&amp;gt;&amp;lt;stop signal&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene C&amp;gt;...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually genes themselves have modular structure as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;       exon        intron          exon
&amp;lt;gene A - part 1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene A - part 2&amp;gt;...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splicing enzymes cut out unrelated parts.
What if a function of a splicing enzyme changes?
If we have a gene with 3 exons (denote them 1, 2, 3), after splicing and gluing back we can get - 123, 12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3
(i.e. 7 different proteins out of one gene). This allows tissue specific expression of genes.
Same gene will produce different types of proteins in different parts of the body due to different splicing enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are splicing enzymes which can cut inside exons (not in-between). 
I.e. in the example above, after slicing one can get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;some part of &quot;gene A - part 1&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;gene A - part 2&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, even more proteins can be created from one gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another discovery - there is non-coding DNA between genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;       gene A    &amp;gt;  non coding DNA   &amp;lt;      gene B     &amp;gt;
&amp;lt;A1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A2&amp;gt;-------------------&amp;lt;B1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;B2&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;95% of all DNA is non-coding.
Non-coding DNA is an instruction booklet when to activate which genes (i.e. on/off switches).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are proteins (transcription factors) which turn these switches on/off (i.e.
promote or repress some sequences of genes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same promoter can enable more than one gene (i.e. networks of genes). Any gene can 
have multiple different switches (i.e. can belong to different networks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, DNA does not “know” what it is doing, it is just a readout. The one in control is the one
controlling transcription factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, environment can affect genes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in cells there are sensors which activate some transcription factors when energy level is low&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gene expression in the cell can be regulated by environment somewhere else in the body (e.g.
through hormones - testosterone causes your muscles to grow)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or even outside of the body (pheromones).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNA itself is wrapped in chromatin, which opens up for transcription factors.
I.e. it can regulate which transcription factors can reach DNA at all.
Parts of chromatin can be even permanently closed to silence a specific gene forever.
Epigenetics studies regulation of access to gene sequences.
For example, in rats the way mother behaves can affect stress hormones of her kids permanently
through this mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the most interesting part of DNA is not shape of proteins, but when it is active
(i.e. DNA has if-then clauses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetics is about fertilization, epigenetics is about development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-5-molecular-genetics-ii&quot;&gt;Lecture 5: Molecular genetics II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mutation in a splicing factor can cause very dramatic changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;A1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;more data&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A3&amp;gt;
can become
A1|A2' + A2''|A3
instead of
A1|A2|A3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get a mutation in a promoter. This changes the activated gene network (i.e. completely new
if-then clause). In other words, there are amplifying effects of small changes when they happen in splicing factors or promoters.
In vols one promoter change defines whether they are monogamous or polygamous.
A large share of differences between us and chimps are changes in transcription factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, evolutionary changes are mostly driven by regulatory changes in DNA, not in protein encoding itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dna-shuffling&quot;&gt;DNA shuffling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants can’t run away, so they have tricks to shuffle their DNA as a response to a stressor.
Immune system in animals does this shuffling too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shuffle DNA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate antibodies based on obtained DNA sequences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See whether they work against the pathogen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathogens can do the same to fight antibodies. This is a coevolutionary arm race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process also happens when your neurons are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By moving parts of DNA around you can have large macro consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing “if dehydrated, then wake up kidneys” to “if dehydrated, then also ovulate” 
allows seasonal mating. Mate during dry season to give birth during raining season.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“if smells like me, then don’t mate (incest taboo)” -&amp;gt; “if smells like me, cooperate”
creates kin selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such shuffling allows to introduce variability in degrees of an effect as well
(e.g. if smells very much like me - cooperate very much, a little bit like me - cooperate a bit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have clauses “if &lt;some hormone=&quot;&quot;&gt;, then&quot;. These can be shuffled as well.
E.g. glucocorticoids suppress immune system. If you swap it with progesterone,
then this is useful during pregnancy (no immune system response to fetus).
But immune system can overshoot after pregnancy and this leads to autoimmune diseases.
I.e. one &quot;small&quot; change (which hormone) has large macro consequences.&lt;/some&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One single base pair change can cause diseases, which will kill at 3 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, such macro changes have negative effect. It is just unlikely to stumble on something
positive. Thus, there is stabilizing selection against macro mutational changes, i.e. long periods of stasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;speed-of-evolutionary-changes&quot;&gt;Speed of evolutionary changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution has selective bottlenecks - events through which only individuals with some trait can get through.
Cheetahs has got through one and now they are highly inbreed (you can transplant tissue from one to another
and it won’t be rejected).
Such bottlenecks create circumstances of punctuated radical change. This “rapid” change can still take
thousands of generations (which is a lot for biologists and not that much for paleontologists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macro mutational changes - invention of new proteins and networks.
Micro mutational changes - changes in function of preexisting proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. immune systems in chimps and humans differ only through micro changes,
while development - macro differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of “fast” changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westernized diet causes diabetes. Populations which get introduced to western diets
get a very high rate of diabetes. With time the most vulnerable don’t pass their genes and
rate of diabetes starts to go down (evolution of resistance). This happened within a century.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Siberian foxes have been bred for only 35 generations for tameness
(calmness around people). They started looking like cute puppies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/5_fox_ears_like_puppy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fox looking like puppy&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first domesticated fox to have floppy ears, 1969 (source: “The silver fox domestication experiment” Dugatkin, 2018, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-018-0090-x&quot;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/5_fox_facial_characters_like_puppy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fox face looking like puppy&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domesticated foxes have juvenile facial features, including shorter snout (source: “The silver fox domestication experiment” Dugatkin, 2018, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-018-0090-x&quot;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In other words, they’ve got dog-like traits - e.g. wagging their tails around people.
  Actually breeding for tameness is equivalent to breeding for acting like a child and
  infantile traits (being dependent on others).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Their fur changed too. Ironically in the process of breeding they became useless economically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is antibiotic resistance. Bacterias can develop resistance to our drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, traits evolve as groups. Thus, there are many punctuated changes at the same time.
If you have enough of them, this will look like gradual change (gradualism).
In some sense both models (gradualism and punctuated equilibrium) are correct at the same.
Punctuated equilibrium is observed on individual trait level and gradualism when considering
multiple traits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Continuing writing a summary for Robert Sapolsky’s course “Human Behavioral Biology”.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are sure that you will buy something and there happens to be a discount for it,
you save money by buying with the discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expiration-date-discounts&quot;&gt;“Expiration date” discounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with discounts motivated by a product reaching its expiration date.
Basically all products have some expiration date. After that date supermarkets
can’t sell the product anymore, i.e. they lose the money used to buy the product in the first place.
Thus, they are motivated to incentivize people to buy the product before the expiration date. 
When there is not much time left, they create this incentive by adding a discount.
Usually in German supermarkets it is 30% off and usually it is added 1-2 days before
the expiration date, but occasionally this can happen even 1 week in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, this is a way to save 30% on some of your food. This mostly works for food
with shorter storage time like meat and bread (but not e.g. canned food).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this safe? Yes, the food hasn’t actually expired yet.
I also suspect that food producers actually have some safety margin
in the expiration date. In other words they may set the expiration date much earlier to be extremely sure that the
product won’t go bad before that time. This is just my speculation though. Overall, I am not aware of any safety issues
with this approach. Obviously, you should inspect food you buy using all your senses and trust your self preservation
mechanisms, but this applies to anything you consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we can’t just store such food in the fridge for long. One example usage is to cook it soonish.
Usually once you cook it, you can store it for a bit longer or you can just consume the cooked food immediately.
To save even more, you can freeze such foods (this works especially well for meat).
This way you can store it for couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discounts are more frequent on Saturdays. I suspect this is because the shops are closed on Sundays, so on Saturday they have to sell
all food which would otherwise go bad on Sunday and Monday. This works even better before large holidays (e.g. Christmas)
presumably for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weekly-discounts&quot;&gt;Weekly discounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the second kind of discounts. Almost all popular shops in Germany have “random” discounts which change each week. 
This time they are not related to the expiration date (i.e. there is nothing unusual about the products).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-to-explain-this&quot;&gt;Ways to explain this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of hypotheses why supermarkets do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This brings people to the supermarket itself.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once a person is there, they can lose their self control and buy more stuff (even non-discounted).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The time spent getting to the shop can be considered as a sunk cost and promote buying more as well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discount itself may promote buying more of the discounted product, i.e. “I don’t actually need this,
but next week there will be no discount, so I should buy it now to get the discount”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storing stuff presumably costs money. Occasionally it may be better to sell stuff with a discount than to store it. I.e. the shop may
“pass” you some portion of the money they would otherwise pay for storage, but which they managed to save by you buying the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-to-discover&quot;&gt;Ways to discover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 major ways to discover such discounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the shop itself and look for brightly colored price tags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check shop’s magazines online (the German keyword is “Prospekt”,
e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lidl.de/de/online-prospekt&quot;&gt;Lidl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penny.de/angebote/prospekt-der-woche/&quot;&gt;Penny&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netto-online.de/ueber-netto/Online-Prospekte.chtm&quot;&gt;Netto&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely prefer the second approach, since it is much more efficient (takes less time and you don’t look
at non-discounted products at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-pitfalls&quot;&gt;Possible pitfalls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should keep in mind that supermarkets are doing this for a long time and, thus, in the end this must be
profitable for them. As a result you should be careful and make sure that you are actually the one
benefiting from these discounts. I can imagine the following possible pitfalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you able to control yourself at the shop itself and stick to buying only what you originally planned?
Lists help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t need something in the first place, you just lose money by buying it (even when it is heavily discounted).
E.g. you never eat rice, there is no point in buying it, even when it costs 50% less this week. Instead you should focus on things you
would buy anyway. However, if your uncle loves rice and consumes 3 kilograms of it during his visits, buying rice with 50% discount
and storing it saves you money.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There is a neat way in which you can check the magazines to avoid this issue - look only at the
product pictures (but not prices) at first. I.e. if you don’t need something, don’t even check its price. Once you find
something you need, check its price.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discount on a more expensive product may be not a discount for you.
E.g. you use shampoo A, which costs 1 euro per liter, but there is a discounted shampoo B which costs only 2 euro per liter
instead of its normal price of 4 euro. If you buy B, you actually lose 1 euro (i.e. discounted B price minus normal A price) instead of
saving 2 euro as it might have looked at first.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another variation of this is seasonal food price fluctuations. E.g. in winter watermelons can have a discounted price of 
 only 0.99 per kilo instead of 1.99. However, they cost 0.4 per kilo during the season. So you still in some sense lose
 money when paying discounted 0.99. Obviously, if you consume watermelons all year round, you would actually save, so go for it!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another example could be if a shop increases the price right before having a discount. 
 I don’t think this is intentionally done in Germany, but still worth keeping in mind especially in other countries.
 Usually you start remembering normal prices for main staples with time. Alternatively, if you track your expenses 
 in great detail, you could use that info to double check the price (e.g. how much did this cost last time I bought it?).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different offers in magazines can apply to different dates. Yes, they like to have 5 pages with entire week discounts, 
followed by one page for only e.g. Mon-Wed discounts. I think this is intended, because then people may miss this and
when they buy a lot of stuff in addition to discounted things (but you shouldn’t do this anyway), they will miss that
they are buying without the discount. However, if you don’t buy much, just check the receipt after buying. Normally, there is a paper
magazine in the shop itself, so you can double check the discounted price there (or even show it to the cashier).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There may be no discounted price tags on Monday yet. I’ve got an impression that discounted price tags appear after some time.
So if you go on Monday morning, either take the paper magazine or note down the prices you expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-can-i-save&quot;&gt;How much can I save?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends on you and how flexible you are. For example, Jacob from &lt;a href=&quot;http://earlyretirementextreme.com/&quot;&gt;Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/a&gt; suggests to buy &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; discounted food and then decide what to cook out of it. This definitely requires quite some creativity
and may be not that convenient. Alternatively you can go for some middle ground solution. For example, one can buy discounted food
which can be stored for a long time. This mostly includes canned and frozen foods (already frozen vegetables/fruits or self frozen meat).
Canned foods can be easily stored 1-2 years, so it is possible to buy reasonably large discounted batches and just store it and use
whenever there is a need. Already frozen foods also have large lifespan, you just need a freezer and a reliable energy source.
For self frozen there is no clear time bound, but its state may start to become worse after e.g. 3 months, so that’s a good rule of thumb
I use. This way you still have flexibility (you can cook what you want right now), while partially benefiting from discounts available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observed 10-30% discounts, so if you manage to buy 100 euro of discounted food, you would save 10-30 euro. 
While this is not a life changing sum of money and you definitely shouldn’t rely on this discount in your
FIRE calculations (otherwise the calculations are too tight, trust me), it is also not that much of an effort and can be
even pleasant if you like optimizing your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may think here that this is not worth their time, because they earn so much more than that.
I’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;/post/my-time-costs-x-fallacy&quot;&gt;looked into this (“My time costs X” fallacy)&lt;/a&gt;.
In this particular case you can check the magazines literally in 5-10 minutes and you would have to go the shop anyway
(unless you order your food online, but then you have more fruitful ways to save money, for example, by not ordering
food online).&lt;/p&gt;
