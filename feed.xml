explain treating themselves something nice. The expressions itself often comes from
their workplace. At first, this felt ok to me, but when taking into account
Financial Independence / Early Retirement, I can see that one’s employer
can be incentivized in one following this expression. Let’s see how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work hard, play hard. Sounds pretty innocent and reasonable. You do a great job, 
you get to enjoy its results and “rest”. It also seems to make sense to use your time 
as efficiently as possible in both cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when working - to improve your results,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when resting - to rest better and to have more fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often “Play hard” part involves
spending a lot of money. E.g. one could consider vacation nearby (e.g.
if they live in Germany, some city in Germany or neighboring country) or some exotic
far away destination (like Costa Rica). In the process one can say “I worked very hard, now I 
deserve playing hard, so Costa Rica it is”. You see the principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;here-comes-fire&quot;&gt;Here comes FIRE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Work hard, play hard” makes sense before one knows about FIRE. I have to admit 
that at some point in my life even I used “Play hard” part to decide whether to spend money.
However in the context of FIRE, it is very easy to see dangers of this
expression and why it can be good for one’s employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentive-1-obvious-one-work-hard-for-productivity&quot;&gt;Incentive #1 (obvious one): Work Hard for productivity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers love when one works hard. They are extremely incentivized
to make this the case. The harder their employee works, the better the results are,
the more money employer makes. Normally one doesn’t get all the benefit which they
produce at work propagated back to them. Thus, even after a raise or a bonus for good
work, the employer still benefits from one’s hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentive-2-another-obvious-one-play-hard-for-rest&quot;&gt;Incentive #2 (another obvious one): Play Hard for rest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to work hard, you need to recharge your energy well.
Otherwise, you will burn out. Thus, based on the previous incentive, employers
also love when you rest very well and recharge before coming to work. Thus, if one
spends their personal time for their own very effective rest, this is very positive
for their employer (better performance, more money) and somewhat positive to the person
(somewhat more money theoretically, burnout sucks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentive-3-surprising-play-hard-to-spend&quot;&gt;Incentive #3 (surprising): Play Hard to spend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is hard to notice without FIRE. Basically, imagine that your salary is magically 
2 million EUR per month. After couple months, you could likely quit, since you
will have enough money in your stash (not for getting 2kk EUR monthly during your FIRE, but still enough).
And now imagine that your employer manages to convince you to “Play Hard”. Heck, you
are making 2 million EUR per month. You can spend 1.8 million EUR every month and
still save 200k. You will still save more than majority of people. Very few people earn that much,
so you deserve this! Then you find many fancy ways to spend a lot of money. Inflate your
lifestyle. After vacation on a yacht in the Caribbean and an amazing 10 room apartment
with a jacuzzi (or 5), having a vacation in Stuttgart or living in a studio apartment
feels hard. And now you can’t quit anymore. You need a lot of money to support such
a lifestyle. By saving 10% of your income, you need ~51.4 years to save for your retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably don’t get payed 2kk EUR monthly (otherwise, wow, I am proud that you
read this). However, the same approach applies to any salary. I just exaggerated the example
to make it easier to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentive-4-questionable-play-hard-to-not-grow&quot;&gt;Incentive #4 (questionable): Play Hard to not grow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you don’t know about “Play Hard” and just work.
In the evening, you tinker with various projects, learn new skills.
In some sense, this is good for your employer, because theoretically
you may become more productive. But at the same time,
this makes your more valuable on the job market. The raises are usually 
lower than starting bonuses (i.e. one will likely end up with more
money by changing a job instead of getting a raise). Thus, in this case
there is a risk that you will leave your employer. E.g. some other
company notices your projects and makes a more generous offer. 
Or you can even start a startup. I feel like the risk of losing you is higher
for the employer than the benefits from your learning. And with
“Play Hard” you are directed to just have fun without long lasting
effects (except rest and spending money). I understand that for some
of us, “playing” may involve learning or tinkering, but in the general
case this is considered work and normally people wouldn’t use this activities
for their leisure time. Even though it would make them much happier
(e.g. due to being in the flow, according to “The science of wellbeing” course, 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;summary of which I already posted&lt;/a&gt;
).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if you notice yourself using “I worked hard, I may play hard” argument, especially to spend
more money, try to stop for a moment and reconsider. Is this really what you want? Is this really
beneficial for you and your life? I am pretty sure there are enough cases when it is, but your
employer may be heavy incentivized in you following this expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another funny way to understand this expression could have been “Work Hard” = “Save for FIRE”,
“Play Hard” = “Enjoy FIRE”, but even this does not work well. This seams to involve life style
inflation and implicitly says that your FIRE saving phase sucks and you won’t 
“work” during FIRE. It doesn’t have to be this way. Ideally your lifestyle shouldn’t change much.
You just replace ordinary job time (i.e. 40h a week) with some other activities, which you enjoy more.
This can be whatever you like (even just continue working).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I would rephrase the expression as “Work reasonably ok, analyze incentives, consider saving for
FIRE, enjoy your life in the ways you like (this does not have to be rest or expensive “play”, but it may”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy effective work and conscious rest!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Financial Independence / Early Retirement&quot;, &quot;Frugality&quot;]" /><category term="reflection" /><summary type="html">I’ve discovered that people use expression &quot;Work hard, play hard&quot; as a way to explain treating themselves something nice.

Let’s say you get \(Y\) EUR each month. The overall money you get over time is \( M = Y * t \), where \(t\) is time.
This resembles a physics equation for movement with constant speed (i.e. no acceleration).
Let’s explore this similarity and try to add acceleration to FIRE and get FIRE\(^2\) (FIRE squared, I just made this
name up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;physics-prelude&quot;&gt;Physics prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an object moves with a constant speed \(V\) in one dimensional space,
then its position can be obtained by \(x = V t + x_0\), where \(t\) is time
and \(x_0\) is the initial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case above assumes no acceleration (the speed is constant).
If we have constant acceleration the equation becomes \(x = \frac{a t^2}{2} + V t + x_0\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-fire&quot;&gt;Back to FIRE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In physics the object moves by \(V\) for each unit of time.
In FIRE one gets \(Y\) EUR each month (i.e. unit of time).
Basically, if we denote cumulative number of money obtained through FIRE as \(C\),
the equation is similar to the equation above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C = Y t&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s try to add acceleration here.
The equation becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C = \frac{a t^2}{2} + Y t&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
Y = a t + \text{&lt;initial value&gt;} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? 
The first month we get \(Y\). The second month we get already \(Y + a\).
The third - \(Y + 2a\) and so on. In other words, the amount we get from
FIRE each month (our speed) should grow by \(a\) each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s check whether equation above works as we expect. At \( t = 1 \) 
the value is \( C = \frac{a}{2} + Y \), but we expect only \( Y \). This is likely, because the
speed in physics grows continuously, while here in FIRE the process is discrete.
E.g. for \( t = 0.5 \), the formula above gives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
Y = 0.5 a  + \text{&lt;initial value&gt;} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, let’s try to build our own equation then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At time \( t = 0 \), we have 0 EUR overall and our monthly income is \( Y \).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\( t = 1 \), we get \( Y \), overall we have \( Y \) and our monthly income becomes \( Y + a \)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\( t = 2 \), we get \( Y + a \), overall \( 2Y + a \), income \( Y + 2a \)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\( t = 3 \), we get \( Y + 2a \), overall \( 3Y + 3a \), income \( Y + 3a \)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\( t = 4 \), we get \( Y + 3a \), overall \( 4Y + 6a \), income \( Y + 4a \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see the equation is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
C = t Y + \text{&lt;something&gt;} \cdot a %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first we add no \( a \), then \( a \), then \( 2a \) and so on.
Thus, this is just a sum
of arithmetic progression. The formula for the general case is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;S = (x_1 + x_n) \frac{n}{2}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(i.e. sum of the first \( x_1 \) and last \( x_n \) elements multiplied by quantity \( n \) and divided by two).
In our case it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;(0 + t-1) \frac{t}{2} = (t-1)\frac{t}{2}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final formula becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C = t Y + (t-1)\frac{t}{2} a&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under \( t = 4 \), we get \( 4 Y + 3 \cdot \frac{4}{2} a = 4 Y + 6 a \). Thus, it matches our manual calculations above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;even-further-back&quot;&gt;Even further back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am curious to see how much money one needs to build such FIRE with acceleration (FIRE\(^2\)).
In other words, what kind of safe withdrawal rate one needs for this (could be denotes as SWR\(^2\)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that we want our acceleration to be \( A \) and we start with 0 speed at first.
After the first month we get \( A \) units of money. Under 4% SWR, we would need \( 25 \cdot 12 \cdot A \) EUR overall.
After the second month we get \( 2A \) EUR. In the normal FIRE we would need \( 25 \cdot 12 \cdot 2 \cdot A \) EUR overall
to achieve such withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this approach does not bring us far. Instead let’s say that in the first month we get \( A_1 \) EUR
and in the second month we want to get \( A_2 = A_1 + 1 \) EUR. This means that after \( A_1 \) our stash
should grow such that it starts producing 1 EUR more. Under 4% SWR one needs \( 25 \cdot 12 \cdot 1 = 300 \) EUR to
get 1 EUR per month. Thus, \( A_1 \) should be 300 EUR. Now we can try to extend this further.
We want \( A_2 = A_1 + A \) EUR. Thus, \( A_1 \) should be \( 300A \).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider an example. Our monthly FIRE target is \( 300A \) EUR. We have \( 25 \cdot 12 \cdot 300 \cdot A = 300^2 A \) EUR overall.
After the first month we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;300^2 A \cdot \frac{0.04}{12} = 300 A&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reinvest them. Now our stash becomes
\( 300^2 A + 300 A \) EUR. In the second month, we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(300^2 A + 300 A) \frac{0.04}{12} = 301 A&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, we wanted \( 600 A \). So it feels like the compound interest works differently from the physics motion equation.
Let’s say our principal is \( P \) EUR and it grows by 4% each year, then after \( n \) years we will have
\( P \cdot 1.04 ^ n \).
If we don’t spend anything, our monthly FIRE income after \( n \) years will be \( P \cdot 1.04 ^ n \frac{0.04}{12} \).
In other words, in contrast to the motion equation, here the time \( n \) is in the power. Previously, it was just square multiplied. This is why our analogy breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we know that \( Y = a t \). We can plug income from the above as \( Y \) here and see the acceleration (for simplicity we switch units to years here):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;Y = a n = P \cdot 1.04 ^ n \frac{0.04}{12}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;a = \frac{ P \cdot 1.04 ^ n \frac{0.04}{12} }{n}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words the acceleration is not constant, it grows as well.
In some sense, the real 4% is even better than the constant acceleration case above.
If we want \( Y \) to be \( 2A \), we need \( 2 A \cdot 12 \cdot 25 \) EUR stash. 
Let’s say our initial stash supports \( Y = A \), i.e. it is \( 12 \cdot 25 \cdot A \). 
We know that in \( n \) years it will be \( 12 \cdot 25 \cdot A \cdot 1.04 ^ n \). 
Thus, let’s find \( n \), such that \( Y = 2 A \), i.e. the stash of \( 2 * A * 12 * 25 \) EUR.
This is just \( 1.04 ^ n = 2 \), i.e. \( n = 17.673 \) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.04%5En+%3D+2&quot;&gt;wolfram alpha&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a long time, but when we want \( Y = 3 A \), \( n \) becomes 28.011.
I.e. the jump from \( Y = 2 A \) to \( Y = 3 A \) takes us ~10 years, while the jump from \( A \) to \( 2 A \) takes 17 years.
For \( 1000 A \), \( n \) is 176.125, while for \( 1001 A \), it is 176.151, i.e. one needs only ~10 days to go from
\( Y = 1000 A \) to \( 1001 A \), because the acceleration of compounding is not constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can visualize this well with a plot. Let’s draw \( Y \) for both cases (linear and compounding):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/fire_squared/comparison_10.png&quot; alt=&quot;A plot showing how monthly FIRE income depends on time assuming linear and compounding growth.
Linear is much higher.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, linear is doing much better job at first. There is not much money to work in the compounding case yet.
However, if we look further right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/fire_squared/comparison_100.png&quot; alt=&quot;A plot showing how monthly FIRE income depends on time assuming linear and compounding growth.
This time we look from 1 to 100 on x axis and compounding almost reaches linear.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding starts to reach linear. Even further right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/fire_squared/comparison_200.png&quot; alt=&quot;A plot showing how monthly FIRE income depends on time assuming linear and compounding growth.
This time we look from 1 to 200 on x axis and compounding sky-rockets.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And kaboom! Compounding case just skyrockets.
Further to the right, it looks like linear is just flat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/fire_squared/comparison_300.png&quot; alt=&quot;A plot showing how monthly FIRE income depends on time assuming linear and compounding growth.
This time we look from 1 to 300 on x axis and linear looks completely flat.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the fact that acceleration is not constant feels now obvious. 
Basically, when one has more money, compounding growth has more effect, because each euro works separately. 
While in the physics motion equation, the speed is just time multiplied by acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, building such FIRE scheme when one each months gets \( A \) more money
is not possible with the compounding growth. The compounding growth grows
faster than that scheme (it just starts slow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit sad that my attempt to define FIRE\(^2\) and SWR\(^2\) didn’t work out,
because the real thing is in some sense cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-follow-up&quot;&gt;Possible follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This didn’t workout, because the time goes into power. However, there is a way (logarithm) to move
from exponent to linear. Thus, I could theoretically consider logarithm of the monthly income and try
to do exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Financial Independence / Early Retirement&quot;]" /><category term="fire" /><category term="analysis" /><category term="mini-project" /><summary type="html">Financial Independence / Early Retirement is about reaching a state, in which you get enough passive income to live.

Let’s see how it 
affects early retirement in Germany. In other words how one should account
for health insurance contribution when planning and by how much this delays
the FIRE date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual FIRE advice aka 4% rule aka Trinity Study says “multiple your yearly expenses by 25 and that’s how much you need”.
It is easy to forget about some implicit expenses though, e.g. taxes and health insurance, which are payed automatically
if you are an employee. Obviously, one has
plenty of time to look into these topics during their saving phase. This is me doing precisely that here.
Thus, let’s see how health insurance in Germany affects one’s FIRE and how to account for this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-vs-public&quot;&gt;Private vs Public&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I am not very familiar with private health insurance in Germany. I’ve heard from multiple sources
that the monthly contributions in the (ordinary) retirement can become high. Overall the concept
looks a bit fishy to me. One pays less and gets a better service. Moreover, the one who referred you
usually gets a couple thousand EUR referral bonus, which also does not fit well with paying less and getting better service.
This is my not that well researched opinion, so if you know more, I would appreciate you sharing your knowledge with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I will consider a public insurance (for simplicity, Techniker Kran­ken­kas­se aka TK, in the worst case one
could switch to TK if they have something different).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tk-contributions&quot;&gt;TK contributions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can have no usual salary-based income during their retirement, but they still have to
pay health insurance contributions. Surprise-surprise. TK has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tk.de/service/app/2002868/beitragsrechner/beitragsrechner.app&quot;&gt;a calculator&lt;/a&gt;,
which supports only employees, self-employed and students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/insurance_during_fire/tk_calculator.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of Techniker Kran­ken­kas­se contribution calculator intro-screen asking to choose out of employee, self-employed or student.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fig. Choose your destiny! Obviously there won’t be a FIRE option with Mr Money Mustache picture…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tk.de/techniker/leistungen-und-mitgliedschaft/beitraege-beitragssaetze/beitragssaetze/tk-beitragssatz-und-zusatzbeitrag-2021472&quot;&gt;another page&lt;/a&gt;, which has&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Weitere Freiwillig Versicherte wie Beamte oder Versicherte ohne Beschäftigung&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the second part is what we are interested in - “insured without employment”.
This finally brings us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tk.de/techniker/leistungen-und-mitgliedschaft/versicherung/freiwillige-krankenversicherung-tk/haeufige-fragen-zu-beitraegen-fuer-freiwillig-versicherte/beitragshoehe-freiwillig-versichert-nicht-erwerbstaetig-2006970&quot;&gt;the page&lt;/a&gt; with all the details.
There are two components of TK insurance (health Krankenversicherung and long term care Pflegeversicherung).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the health insurance, there are two rates - reduced (ermäßigte Beitragssatz) and general (allgemeine Beitragssatz).
The reduced rate is 14.7%. It applies to capital gain income (Einnahmen aus Kapitalvermögen, Aktien und Ähnlichem).
There are also lower and upper bound contributions - 152.64 and 667.01 EUR respectively per month.
The general rate is 15.3%, but this is irrelevant here, since it does not affect capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the long term care insurance, one pays 3.05% of their income and the contribution bounds are 31.67 &amp;amp; 138.39 EUR per month.
People who are older than 23 and have no children have to pay increased rate of 3.3% (bounds - 34.26 &amp;amp; 149.74 EUR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity (and the worst case scenario), let’s assume that we have no kids (and are older than 23). 
Thus, we already have to pay at least 152.64 (minimum contribution for health insurance) + 34.26 EUR (minimum contribution
for long term case insurance) = 186.90 EUR each month.
This amount will grow if we have large enough capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact-on-fire&quot;&gt;Impact on FIRE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is already clear that one needs to add at least 186.90 EUR to their FIRE monthly expenses.
Under 4% rule this means saving 186.90 * 12 * 25 = 56070 EUR more than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we will have capital gains too, which may increase the contributions.
Both Krankenversicherung and Pflegeversicherung lower bounds map to 1038 EUR income:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;152.64/0.147 = 1038.36&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;34.26/0.033 = 1038.18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, once your income crosses 1038 EUR per month, you will have to pay more.
The upper bounds map to 4537 EUR of income:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;667.01/0.147 = 4537.48&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;149.74/0.033 = 4537.57&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conclusion, unless you go for a fat FIRE, you will have to pay
max(186.90, &amp;lt;capital gains&amp;gt; * (14.7% + 3.3%)) each month for the health and long term care insurances.
As a rough rule of thumb, if you plan to spend X EUR each month during FIRE,
you have to save for X + max(186.90, 0.18*X) to account for the insurances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-go-deeper&quot;&gt;Let’s go deeper.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may feel like we are done, but not yet. The funny fact is that e.g. these 186.90 EUR will in the worst case be included
in your capital gains too. I.e. you will have to pay insurance contributions on your insurance contributions. 
Thus, the real number should be larger. Let’s find it.
So again we want to get X EUR after paying insurance contribution. 
Let’s say we should save Y EUR more to pay for the insurance.
Now we can calculate the insurance contribution in the worst case (when all the money are coming from capital gains).
It is max(186.90, 0.18*(X + Y)). Now we know that after paying the contribution
we want to have X left. Thus, we get an equation. It is (our overall income) - (contribution) = (what we want to be left with):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(X + Y) - max(186.90, 0.18*(X + Y)) = X
Y = max(186.90, 0.18*(X + Y))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can consider two cases.
Let’s say the max collapses to 186.90. 
This happens when 0.18*(X + Y) &amp;lt;= 186.90, i.e. 0.18*X &amp;lt;= 186.9 - 0.18*Y or X &amp;lt;= 1038.33 - Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// A bit of a side thought here, but I probably should look into using TeX or something…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Y = 186.90, when X &amp;lt;= 1038.33 - Y = 1038.33 - 186.90 = 851.43.
This is a simpler case, since here we don’t technically pay contribution on our contribution,
because we hit the lower bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then let’s say the max is reduced to the right argument. This means
X &amp;gt; 1038.33 - Y.
In this case Y = 0.18*(X + Y), i.e. 0.82*Y = 0.18*X and Y = 0.2195*X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now I feel very rigorous. If during your FIRE you planned to have 851.43 EUR or less
monthly without taking into account taxes and insurances, you need to add to that 186.90 EUR,
i.e. X becomes X + 186.90 EUR. This will cover the insurance contribution. 
If your X is larger than 851.43 EUR, then you should have 1.2195*X instead per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the very pessimistic worst case for the insurances (we don’t look at taxes yet,
this is planned for later, the dessert, so to say). In reality our monthly capital gain
won’t be the entire X (especially at first). However, with time it will slowly approach X.
I.e. with time the larger and larger portion of our monthly money will be coming from capital gains
and not from our already taxed savings. This is easy to prove, because 
the non-taxed part grows with time and already-taxed part only gets depleted.
Thus…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-go-even-deeper&quot;&gt;Let’s go even deeper.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be dead sure you have enough for insurance, go with saving
for 1.2195*X EUR per month (when your original monthly plan was X).
In other words for each 1000 EUR of free monthly money during FIRE, plan to save for 1219.5 EUR instead.
Or if your FIRE target was 300k EUR, change it to 300k * 1.2195 = 365850 EUR to account for
insurances (worst case upper bound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a very big deal. This definitely means saving couple years more.
Thus, if we can get a more real and lower estimate, this would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, getting this estimate is very non-trivial.
There are multiple forces at play - growth of capital, First-In-First-Out order of selling.
E.g. your older investments will likely have more capital gains then your fresher ones, 
but you will have to sell the older ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, having a simple spreadsheet here happende to be not feasible and I will have to write a proper
javascript calculator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TODO: write a calculator to get more realistic estimate for how much more one needs to save
to account for insurances during FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-with-my-approach&quot;&gt;Issues with my approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This can change gazillion times before one actually FIREs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes will have their impact, so to be 100% correct one needs to take them into account as well.
I plan another series of posts about taxes in FIRE, so addressing this issue may become a part of it. Let’s see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perhaps there exist better selling strategies. Does one have to sell a little bit each month?
Could it be better to hit the upper bound once and then pay the lower bound contribution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your FIRE target is X EUR without taking into account insurances and taxes.
If you want to account for insurances, your FIRE target should become at most 1.2195 * X EUR.
This is the worst case scenario, which assumes entire monthly amount coming from capital gains
in Germany with TK insurance. I.e. this is an upper bound. In reality it may be somewhat
lower. Stay tuned to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;peculiar-question-of-morality&quot;&gt;Peculiar question of morality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing this, I’ve thought for a bit about morality of such somewhat low insurance
contributions during FIRE.
Basically one can end up paying ~200 EUR per month for the same service.
However, don’t forget that you already payed insurance contributions from your salary
while you were saving the money. Thus, if you average your contributions over your life,
it will likely end up being comparable to working entire life without FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

as possible (especially when aiming for Financial Independence / Early Retirement).
Let’s focus on the phase, when one saves for FIRE, and see the magnitude of the effect
of such a delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own unique situation. This post is based on a number of assumptions,
thus, don’t rely on it as is. Have a look at the assumption and see how well this applies 
to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly known that usually one should delay realizing their investment capital gains
as much as possible to increase their returns. Basically, instead of just paying the tax now, one can
temporarily keep it and continue getting investment growth (compounding) out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;simulation&quot;&gt;Simulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example of Annet.
We will use the following assumptions about Annet and her life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lives in Germany&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pays German capital gain tax and always 26.375% (25% tax itself &amp;amp; additional 5.5% of it as solidarity tax)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has other income, i.e. the capital gain tax is never reduced to progressive income tax.
This is a strong assumption, but not for the collection phase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;never uses 801 tax-free capital gain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no dividends and no tax prepayment (this is different from the current German system)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;starts from 0 in January 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(the strongest assumption) the market always has constant yearly and monthly returns.
I use 4% return per year or equivalently 0.32737% per month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;earns 2k EUR and invests 1k EUR each month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume that Annet contributes 1000 EUR every month.
Her investment growths by 0.32737% at the end of every month.
I.e. she has 0 at 1st of January 2019. She invests 1000 in the end of January.
In the end of February her 1000 grow into 1003.27 and she invests another 1000,
thus, having 2003.27 pre-tax overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we compare 2 options. The first option is delaying realizing capital gains as
much as possible. Basically she never sells until becoming FIRE. At that point, she will pay 26.375% on her
capital gains. The second option is realizing capital gains as fast as possible (every month, alternatively
having only distributing ETFs).
Basically, once her 1000 grow into 1003.27, she immediately sells them (or receives dividends)
and buys the same asset again. While doing this, she pays 26.375% tax on the growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This is just a simplified model. Re-buying the same asset might be considered a wash sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also normally one does not sell everything after becoming FIRE, but here we
assume this to be able to compare the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spreadsheet&quot;&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve prepared &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11iki1iPJawRdpLVxPoIGkBx0Oq5MowwRENDcuVZvbRQ/edit&quot;&gt;a Google Spreadsheet with the calculation&lt;/a&gt;. You can play with it by making a copy first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to 4% rule, her FIRE target is 300k. 
In the first case, she reaches 300k (after tax) in 222 months (July 2037) and pre-tax she has
327k. In the second case she has only 294k EUR at this point (i.e. 1.7% less).
She needs 4 more months (1.8%) to reach 300k EUR post-tax in the second case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-case&quot;&gt;General case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above we considered only one particular setting. Now let’s have a look how the two cases differ
under various yearly investment returns and time horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/delaying_capital_gains/difference_based_on_return.png&quot; alt=&quot;a plot showing how difference (in percents) between the two cases (delaying capital gains and
realizing them monthly) depends on number of months invested and yearly return on
investment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, for 7% yearly return and 30 years, the difference crosses 12%, which is a substantial amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-research&quot;&gt;Further research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible improvements of the simulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;take into account 801 EUR capital gain tax free every year.
This won’t affect the result too much though as we have already seen
in 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/801-tax-free-capital-gains&quot;&gt;my previous post about tax-free 801 EUR per year&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, this can improve the second case (realizing gains immediately),
but at most 801 * 0.26375 = 211.26 EUR per year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;look into FIRE spending phase, which is much more dependent on capital gains.
In this simulation we pretended that we send everything once one reaches FIRE
to compare the two cases. In reality that’s not true. In this case not-realized
capital gains will have even more time to grow, thus, this should make
the difference even larger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;take into account capital gain tax becoming progressive income tax.
Finally, this should reduce the tax paid after FIRE substantially.
Basically, if one has no or little income and their progressive income tax is less
than 25%, they don’t pay 25% on their capital gains either (but their income
tax instead).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;using real market data. Currently I just assume 4% per year growth, which
ignores sequence of returns completely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;taking into account yearly tax prepayment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will address some of these in my follow-up posts, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaying your capital gains matters less than I expected (1.7% difference under 50% saving rate and 4% yearly return case).
However, since by default you don’t realize them, it is better not to do anything extra and just don’t lose these 1.7%.
Overall, 1.7% (or even more if the yearly return is larger than 4%) can be a reasonable sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally one can be forced to realize their capital gains (e.g. an accumulating ETFs gets closed or 
changes its internal structure). Based on the numbers above, it makes sense to try to avoid this to some extent
(e.g. buying same ETFs from different providers).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Simulations&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Investing&quot;, &quot;Financial Independence / Early Retirement&quot;]" /><category term="fire" /><category term="analysis" /><category term="mini-project" /><category term="taxes" /><summary type="html">It is common knowledge that one should delay realizing their capital gains as much as possible (especially when aiming for Financial Independence / Early Retirement).

I personally try to realize at least 801 EUR each year to use this benefit, but I am
now curious how much of a difference in the long term this makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own unique situation. This post is based on a number of assumptions,
thus, don’t rely on it as is. Have a look at the assumption and see how well this applies 
to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met some people who did not bother with these 801€ per year at all. However, I do try to use them.
Basically, when realizing 801€ of capital gains, one pays no taxes in Germany.
Please note that this does not mean that one gets 801€ for free. Nope.
Normally one would pay 26.375% tax (25% capital gain tax and 5.5% of that is solidarity tax).
With this benefit one does not pay this tax for 801€.
Thus, one can get free 801 * 26.375% = 211.26€ each year by doing this. This is definitely
not a life changing sum, but I am curious what the impact is when saving e.g. for FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dividends do count against this sum as well. Moreover not realized capital gains now have to be partially
realized up to basic interest rate (Basiszins) each year which goes against these 801€ as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;simulation&quot;&gt;Simulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider Jannet.
We will use the following assumptions about Jannet and her life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lives in Germany&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;does not have any other capital gains except from her stock portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has other income, i.e. the capital gain tax is always 26.375% and never gets replaced
with the progressive income tax (in a future post I will look more into how this works).
This is very realistic for the collection phase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;starts from 0€ in January 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(the strongest assumption) the market always has constant yearly and monthly returns of
 4% and 0.32737% respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;earns 2k€ and invests 1k€ each month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we assumed above, Jannet contributes 1000€ every month to her portfolio.
Her investment grows by 0.32737% at the end of every month.
I.e. she has 0 at 1st of January 2019. She invests 1000€.
In the end of February her 1000€ grow into 1003.27€ and she invests another 1000€,
thus, having 2003.27€ overall pre-tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we compare the two following options. The first option is to never realize capital
gains during the savings phase. I.e. she has 2003.27€ pre-tax and she does nothing.
The second option is to realize capital gains up to 801€ per year, in order to use this
tax benefit. I.e. she would immediately realize these 3.27€ and have 2003.27€ already taxed.
At some point she will reach 801€ for this year and stop realizing capital gains
to delay paying capital gain taxes into the future (there will be a post on how this delaying
affects the investment growth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we compare the two approaches, we always compare post-tax sum. I.e as if Janet sold all her 
investments at that months. Here we take into account 801€ in both approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spreadsheet&quot;&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve prepared &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WGdB1HYkCbbj0_C1Ap3ELpAWIsxr97B4lyN7mU6CEAE/edit&quot;&gt;a Google Spreadsheet with the simulation&lt;/a&gt;. You can play with it by making a copy.
The simulation inputs are all the way on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, making the spreadsheet was quite tricky.
I had multiple mistakes at first and had to compare the numbers with my python simulation
to fix them. As a result, the spreadsheet is quite complicated and may be hard to follow.
However, the most interesting field is diff percentage (i.e. difference in percents between
the two options). There are also actual overall savings after tax for each months (columns adjacent
to the diff column).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to 4% rule, Jannet’s FIRE target is 300k€. 
In the first case, she reaches 300k€ after tax in 222 months (July 2037) and pre-tax she had
327k. In the second case she reaches 300k€ after tax 2 months earlier (May 2037).
By this time she had realized 14542€ of capital gains tax free by using this 801€ benefit.
I.e. she has got 14542€ * 26.375% = 3835.45€ for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two approaches (in percents) jumps to 1.34% and then slowly falls down to ~1.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s plot the difference for each month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/801_tax_free/jannet_s_case.png&quot; alt=&quot;a plot showing how difference (in percents) between the two cases (delaying capital gains and
realizing at most 801 EUR tax free yearly) depends on number of months invested
for Jannet's case&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does look peculiar and we can make a number of observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for some time the difference stays at 0. This happens before Jannet’s overall capital gains
reach 801€. This is just a consequence of me applying this 801€ bonus when calculating the final amounts
saved in both cases. For example, in May 2019 the investment growth is 32.84€. In the first case,
these are fictitiously realized before the comparison. In the second case, they are realized each month.
In both cases, Jannet pays no tax on these 32.84€, because of 801€ tax-free benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we observe a peculiar unexpected sawtooth pattern. This can be explained
by the yearly nature of this 801€ tax benefit. In January each year, the 801€ counter
is reset. As a result, before Jannet uses this limit completely the difference grows.
However, once Jannet exhausts these 801€ for a given year, the difference stops growing and
actually relative percentage starts slowly decreasing. This happens because the mixed tax sum
(sum of already taxed and not yet taxed parts)
is the same in both cases. Whether a gain is taxed or not does
not impact capital gains obtained from it. As a result, the investment growth
in both cases is exactly the same. Then in the next January, 801€ counter is reset again
and the difference grows for some months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compare the plot with the spreadsheet to see precisely how this happens.
In month 32, Jannet exhausts 801€ for the first time. As a result, for the remaining
months in this year (33-35) the difference falls. Then the 801 counter gets reset
and the difference starts growing again (months 36-41) until it gets exhausted again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-case&quot;&gt;General case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above we considered only one case - investing 1000€ monthly @ 4% yearly return.
Both variables affect the result, e.g. if we invest 10k€ monthly, the effect of
exactly the same old 801€ becomes much smaller. Also, if the investment grows
faster, this will decrease the difference as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, let’s have a look how the difference between the two approaches
depends on yearly returns, monthly investment amount and time saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by extending Jannet’s case (1000€ monthly @ 4% yearly growth) to various yearly
investment returns (1-7%):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/801_tax_free/1000_different_roi.png&quot; alt=&quot;a plot showing how difference (in percents) between the two cases (delaying capital gains and
realizing at most 801€ tax free yearly) depends on time saving and yearly return on
investment when investing 1000€ per month&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, for approximately all yearly return value the difference reaches around 1.2% and the starts to fall
down. The speed of the decrease is larger for higher yearly returns, as we already predicted above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at investing 100€ per months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/801_tax_free/100_different_roi.png&quot; alt=&quot;a plot showing how difference (in percents) between the two cases (delaying capital gains and
realizing at most 801€ tax free yearly) depends on time saving and yearly return on
investment when investing 100€ per month&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observed difference gets much more substantial and reaches 7% at a peak.
This is natural, since 801€ is a substantial amount of money, when one invests 100€ per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining plots for 500, 2000 and 5000€ invested per month you can see in the appendix below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-research&quot;&gt;Further research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible improvements of the simulation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;look into FIRE spending phase, which is much more dependent on capital gains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take into account capital gain tax becoming progressive income tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will address some of these in my follow-up posts, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 801€ tax free capital gains per year do matter! You can get additional 1.2% post tax when investing
1000€ monthly @ 4% yearly by realizing at most 801€ tax free each year.
If you invest less, e.g. 100€, the effect becomes even more dramatic and the difference can reach staggering 7%.
And if you invest something like 5k€ per month, the difference reaches 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, these are free money, which are very easy to get. Thus, I advise you to use this opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that there are multiple ways to use it. In the end, you just need to realize capital gains and I am aware
of the following ways to do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Receive dividends.
If we assume 1-2% of dividends per year, you will use these tax-free 801€ by having 40k-80k€ invested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yearly tax prepayment (Vorabpauschale).&lt;br /&gt;
If we take 0.87% Basiszinses for 2018 and assume 4% yearly growth,
having 801€ / (0.87% * 70%) = ~130k€ already exhausts these 801€.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling something with a win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if you have 130k and the year is positive (i.e there was at least Basiszinses * 0.7% growth),
you don’t have to do anything to realize these 801€. If you have only distributing assets, having 40-80k€
is already enough. Otherwise, you can sell something with a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy realizing 801€ of capital gains each year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corrections&quot;&gt;Corrections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019/07/22:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previously it was assumed that solidarity tax was 5%. It is actually 5.5%.
I.e. one pays 25% * 1.055 = 26.375% capital gain tax. All values and graph have been updates. Thanks to 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/hn_ns/&quot;&gt;u/hn_ns&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit for this correction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeFIRE/comments/cdebkc/germany_how_much_does_one_lose_by_not_realizing/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;
it was pointed out that one can use these 801€ via dividends or Vorabpauschale. I updated the text to make 
this explicit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Here is my impression (somewhat positive) and summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reading this book I discovered that there was a controversy associated with Brian Wansink.
Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wansink&quot;&gt;gives&lt;/a&gt; a good summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These problems included conclusions not supported by the data presented, data and figures duplicated across papers, questionable data including impossible values, incorrect and inappropriate statistical analyses, and “p-hacking”. The lab had 17 papers retracted (one twice) and had 15 corrections issued. On September 20, 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from research and teaching, limiting his activity to cooperating with further investigation of his papers; he resigned effective June 30, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely don’t have enough insight to judge this, but Cornell announced that Wansink would retire
[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/9/19/17879102/brian-wansink-cornell-food-brand-lab-retractions-jama&quot;&gt;source: vox&lt;/a&gt;] (by the way
on 30th of June, i.e. pretty recently) and this is a substantial argument that something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this I decided to read the book anyway, but didn’t pay attention to the precise numbers much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the book felt quite insightful. For some weird unexplainable reason, it also felt somewhat hard and not that interesting to read.
Once I wrote this summary, I also understood that the structure was quite chaotic (i.e. the same or very similar 
piece of advice was mentioned multiple times) and often the topic of a given chapter was not immediately obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book contained many of my observations from my life. I did make some changes in my life and I was definitely able
to observe a lot described in this book around me (e.g. in restaurants and cafes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Score: 3/5 (not a waste of time, but I wouldn’t recommend unless you have bad eating problems, also the fact
that I had to ignore precise numbers due to the controversy affected the score as well, otherwise it could have been 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[note: I have heavily reordered my notes to make them more structured.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple labs studying food choices (like the author’s). Food producers do their research too (e.g. how customers
will like a new product).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have millions of years of evolution telling us to eat as often and as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-suck-at-estimating-how-much-to-eat&quot;&gt;We suck at estimating how much to eat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much we eat is heavily affected by external factors and we underestimate the effect of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each bite we don’t stop to reconsider whether we are now full. Instead we look for external cues (e.g. empty plate
or other people leaving). As a result, the more food you are given, the more food you will eat
(even if you don’t like the food - e.g. stale popcorn).
People mistakenly claim that this does not apply to them.
It also does not matter whether they are hungry. One eats more when given a larger container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People also get anchored. E.g. when they get a signal that the meal is good, they will convince themselves so and vice versa.
Another example: when asked whether apple has 50 or more calories - their average response is 66, when asked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150 or more - the average response becomes 114. That’s how promotions in shops work - any sign with a number promotion
increases purchases by 30-100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try dishing out 20% less than you think you might want before you start eating. People can detect 30%
difference, but not 20%. For fruits &amp;amp; veggies - have 20% more (e.g. cut 20% of pasta, but have
20% more veggies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are bad at remembering what we ate and how much. Normally food does not leave a trace, but when it does
we will eat less (e.g. chicken bones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also don’t notice gaining weight (unless we measure). Our clothes don’t lie - they fit or they don’t.
For dieters, these are called “signal clothes” (e.g. being able to fit in a favorite pair of jeans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We usually try to eat the same portion as yesterday. We think that we will be full if we eat a full plate,
half plate - half full. As a result, if the food looks bigger, we will feel more full (e.g. by adding veggies).
You can do this with air (e.g. keeping a smoothie in blender for longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we think that we ate less that typical volume, we will think that we are hungry. More - full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eat the volume we want, not the calories. E.g. 2x calories food is perceived exactly the same as 0.5x.
People would consider themselves to be exactly the same full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t stop eating when our stomach is full. It seems to be a combination of how much we eat,
taste, swallow, think about food and how long we’ve been eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need 20 minutes to signal satiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often decide how much to eat before putting food in our mouth. We also don’t ask ourselves constantly whether
we are full yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stomach has 3 settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starving (bottom level, not eating for 8 or 18 hours leads to the same feeling)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m full but can eat more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m stuffed (top level, you can’t continue eating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should rely on your internal cues and stop when you are not hungry (instead of when full or
by external cues). This is actually very different from stopping when you are full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See it before you eat it. When preplating, people eat 14% less than when they refill.
Put everything you want to eat on a plate before you start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See it while you eat (e.g. soda bottles or chicken bones).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to eat 20-25% more from larger packages (even worse for snacks).
This applies not only to food (e.g. shampoo, laundry detergent).
Big packages suggest a consumption norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People assume that 1 package is 1 serving.
If you empty six 100 cal servings into a bowl, the serving becomes “how much we want to eat”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brains have a tendency to overfocus on heights at the expense of width. E.g. people
pour more liquid in short wide glasses and underestimate (even bartenders, i.e. with
experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size contrast illusion - we use background objects as a benchmark for estimating sizes.
A larger plate influences you to serve more (same for large spoons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/mindless_eating/illusion.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Ebbinghaus illusion illustration. Two groups of circles. The left one is an orange circle with
large circles around it. The right one - an orange one with small circles around it. 
The orange circles seem to be of different sizes (the left one is smaller), but they are actually the same.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion&quot;&gt;Ebbinghaus illusion&lt;/a&gt; - the central circles are the same
[&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mond-vergleich.svg&quot;&gt;source: Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informing people about this does not help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it is easier to estimate small values (see psychophysics for more details), e.g. building height
or calories you ate. As a result, the bigger the meal, the more people underestimate how much they ate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, mini-size your boxes, bowls and packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 year old children are not affected by the serving size, 5 year old are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Rozin has shown that amnesiac patients ate a second complete meal within 30 minutes after having eat a prior
meal, once they were told it was dinner time
[note: the article has only 2 patients and 3 occasions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00073&quot;&gt;What Causes Humans to Begin and End a Meal? A Role for Memory for What Has Been Eaten, as Evidenced by a Study of Multiple Meal Eating in Amnesic Patients by P. Rozin et al&lt;/a&gt; ].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;Variety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diets based on food restriction work, because people get bored of the same allowed foods and eat less of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the variety of food increases how much we eat. 
“Sensory specific satiety” - senses get numb or sated if they continually experience the same stimuli.
The first of anything is almost always the best. We also eat more, when we simply think there is more variety.
E.g. people eat more M&amp;amp;M’s from a bowl with 10 colors vs. 7 colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friction-ie-visibility--effort&quot;&gt;Friction (i.e. visibility &amp;amp; effort)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see food, we start wanting it and will eat more of it. Every time we see it, we have to say “no”.
Eventually it will turn into “yes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of sight = out of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply thinking of food can make us hungry.
The more you think of something, the more of it you will eat. The more hassle it is to eat, less we eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TODO: buy chopsticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even opening an ice cream fridge can repel people from eating ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distractions&quot;&gt;Distractions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we eat, we often follow eating scripts. Eating with people we like causes overeating - takes longer and we are more
distracted. However, you can finish eating the last. Use the slowest eater at the table as your
pace setter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating is like shopping - the longer you stay at the mall, the more you buy.
If we stare at a cookie, it is only so long before “no, no” becomes “maybe” and then “yes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less people watch TV, the skinnier they are (because they have more time to exercises and fewer reasons to snack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distractions of all kinds make us eat more, forget how much we ate and extend how long we eat - even when
we are not hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;healthy-food-something-free-or-low-like-low-on-fat&quot;&gt;“Healthy” food (“something”-free or low, like low on fat)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We view food as black and white and often consider food free of “something” (e.g. low fat or sugar) as healthy,
even though it may contain similar number of calories (e.g. due to a compensation for the taste).
E.g. people eat more of low fat products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;company-incentives&quot;&gt;Company incentives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No food company is in business to make us fat. They just sell food.
If we want to mindlessly eat fattening food - they will do it. If we want healthy food -
they will find a way to do it (assuming it is profitable). They don’t care if we 
throw away the food as long as we pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;food-perception&quot;&gt;Food perception&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our taste buds are biased by our imagination (see “expectation assimilation” and “confirmation bias”).
That’s why presentation of a dish plays a role. Fancy dish names work the same (preprogram us). Brands work
similarly (set some expectation, e.g. real Coca-Cola vs. a similar drink with a different brand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feelings we have when we first eat some food can follow us for a lifetime (e.g. 
World War II US soldiers who served in the Pacific and had more intense combats tend to dislike Chinese food more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order in which you eat your food (i.e. whether the best first) depends on whether you are the only child
(or from a small family).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can rewire your comfort foods - e.g. start pairing healthier foods with positive events, e.g.
celebrate with “desired” comfort foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;family&quot;&gt;Family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutritional gate keeper - the person who decides / buys food for the house. Also the one cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy food tools extremes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food as reward (ice cream for exam)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food as guilt (finish because people starve)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food as punishment (finish or no TV)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food as comfort (eat and then you will feel better)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diets&quot;&gt;Diets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal diets are deprivation diets. Our body fights against them by using stored calories more efficiently (like during a famine).
This type of diets is like pushing a boulder uphill every second every day.
If we deny ourselves something, we end up craving it even more.
Normally such diets are like sacrifices and after finishing them we are prone to catch up.
The bigger the deprivation the bigger the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting out favorite food is bad, instead we should just eat less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dieting strategy “I will never eat X again in my life” (e.g. fried chicken or ice cream) is destined for a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t deprive yourself - keep comfort foods, but eat them in smaller amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-book-methods&quot;&gt;This book methods&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food tradeoffs - “I can eat X if I do Y” (e.g. I can eat this candy if I take the stairs for the rest of the day).
Food policy - just some rule (e.g. never eat at my desk), this helps not to spend any effort on making this decision each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can use external cues to unknowingly lose weight (i.e. without deprivation).
Mindless margin - we can’t identify whether we ate 300 calories too much or less yesterday,
i.e. the zone where we can slightly overeat or under-eat without noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting only 100 calories a day would prevent weight gain in most of the US population (or walking 1 extra mile a day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just making 3 changes (100 cal each) in your daily food routine is enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half plate rule - half the plate for vegetables and fruits, the other half for protein and starch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb for estimating calories in drinks - 10 calories per ounce (~30 ml) in thin drinks (soft drinks, juice, milk),
20 calories in thick (smoothies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking with ice burns calories (body needs to warm the liquid up) - 1 cal / ounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you drink 8 glasses, 8 ounces (240 ml) of water each with ice, you burn ~70 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes 28 days to break an old habit and replace it with a new one.
Set up a check list (i.e. for each day and each 100 cal change) to make it more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are two miles away from your home. You can run and get there 3x faster, but
walking gets you there as well - at a reasonable and painless rate though. Each step brings you
a little closer. It is the same with losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best diet is the one you don’t know you are on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Book reviews&quot;]" /><category term="book" /><category term="summary" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Recently I read “Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think” by Brian Wansink.

(mostly due to not having anyone else to leave them with). Observing children
in impro context made me think and I made a number of observations about the connection
between impro and childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no clue what impro is, here is my &lt;a href=&quot;/post/beauty-of-impro&quot;&gt;“Beauty of impro” post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, at first the impro-workshop-with-children experience was suboptimal.
Children misbehave. They shout, run, make noises, completely ignore their 
parents and others, bump into everyone, get into dangerous situations.
For me and others this was quite distracting at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impro-gods&quot;&gt;Impro gods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I understood that when we are doing impro, we are in some sense
trying to be like these kids. I.e. we are scared of disapproval and
rejection and try to get over this. The kids don’t know the rules yet,
so they are in some sense free and, thus, can do whatever they like.
I noticed this when we were trying to play a game and one kid
was shouting really badly. Imagine 20 adults trying to play a game
and one kid just shouts loudly making the game impossible.
After that the kid went through the group completely ignoring
everyone. I couldn’t do that and still can’t. I can’t just shout loudly
whenever I want. This is definitely more plausible at an impro
workshop than outside, but, still, if I misbehave too badly,
I don’t have “being a child” card anymore and others will just 
stop inviting me. I can’t just bother others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I now call kids the gods of impro. They are constantly in impro mode
and don’t care about others’ opinion much. They also lose this
ability with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was extremely peculiar to observe all of this during the workshop.
I felt like other people were not that happy about the situation.
At the same time, they were actually implicitly trying to become like 
these kids. They wanted to come on stage and come up with stuff and do 
something unplanned (even if embarrassing or weird). That kid was doing
exactly that and constantly (without even knowing that it may be considered
embarrassing or weird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-did-impro-as-a-kid&quot;&gt;I did impro as a kid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another observation is that I used to do something similar to the scenes we are doing now
during impro workshops (I already mentioned this
in my &lt;a href=&quot;/post/beauty-of-impro&quot;&gt;“Beauty of impro” post&lt;/a&gt;, I suspect that
the idea there is actually coming from this workshop with kids). We would just gather together
and then build some shared reality completely on the go. I have no clue how this could work,
because it must be very hard to agree on something. E.g. one wants to play as some medieval
knights and another as futuristic robots. But somehow it used to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely peculiar that I lost this ability so badly. I clearly remember that it
was very natural as a kid and now it is so hard. I definitely enjoy redeveloping this skill
through impro. However, it may be hard to find someone to “play with”
(especially outside of impro).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playing-with-kids-is-hard&quot;&gt;Playing with kids is hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, playing with kids for me now is extremely hard.
Somehow I find them to be extremely unpredictable. They also don’t
follow any rules. E.g. playing a game where I need to catch them
and then they should catch me can be impossible. I catch one kid
and they just don’t react at all and run away as if I didn’t catch them.
This feels frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I loved to observe how limited I was.
I just had these rules in my mind - “catch game” - 
“I catch him - he starts catching me” - and I was 
following this approach precisely - as a script.
I speculate that the kid does not have this yet.
I don’t know whether they even understood the rules
(presumably, yes, because they did catch others
somehow, they just didn’t react to me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, playing with kids is hard, but it is not their
fault, but mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impro-is-cool-for-kids&quot;&gt;Impro is cool for kids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was also very peculiar that in the end many people
at impro can play well with kids (I am curious whether
this correlates with impro experience). They could
play the same game kids play (including shared reality) and at a similar 
level. Thus, impro workshops are in some sense cool for kids too,
since playing such games with adults must be quite a different
experience. I speculate that adults outside of impro community
may struggle more with such games (or even reject playing completely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I definitely enjoyed observing kids’ behavior during an impro workshop
and their interactions with other.&lt;/p&gt;

disapproving reactions in my mind when others do something.
Here are my reflections - mostly about reactions, handling and this being ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think today is a good day to stop describing the concept of impro in the prelude.
Instead here is a link to
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/beauty-of-impro&quot;&gt;“Beauty of impro” post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is peculiar that beginners in impro worry more about negative reactions
coming from other people. However, with time one learns that everyone
in the group is very nice and kind. Trust appears. I think that I am
close to this state now. I am definitely much less scared of other people 
reacting badly than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, recently I noticed quite a few times that I still get negative
reactions in my head when others do something. This piqued my interest.
On the one hand I learned not to be scared of other people reacting negatively,
but, on the other hand, I still get such reactions myself in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;negative-reactions&quot;&gt;Negative reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can vary a lot. The simplest example is someone making a sub-optimal
(in my view) choice when building their scene. I very quickly get a thought like
“oh, they could have done X and it would have been so much better”. Another example
is when someone does something very unusual or almost controversial
(a controversial joke, weird noises, an insult, does not follow
the rules of the game). Here I mostly become very conscious of their action
and view it negatively for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;handling&quot;&gt;Handling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I don’t express my negative reactions during impro.
I am grateful that others didn’t do this when I just started
doing impro (otherwise this would have quickly killed any desire to
learn). Thus, I don’t do this either. However, this is not
the main reason why I don’t express. Somehow when I remind myself that this is impro
and that I did something similarly crazy, weird or cringey before,
the negative feeling goes away on its own pretty quickly. Somehow this works
even outside of impro. This reminds me about my recent
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/not-getting-angry&quot;&gt;post “How not to get angry?”&lt;/a&gt;.
There I observed that reflecting helps to avoid getting angry about something.
Perhaps the same mechanism is at play here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, such reactions seem to be completely out of my control.
They just appear in my mind as a response to what I observe. 
Like “Oh, this is awkward / weird / cringey “. I am wondering why this happens.
I speculate that this might be a consequence of one trying not to be
weird themselves. You definitely get similar thoughts when you do something
weird yourself (like singing when you have no clue how to do it well).
Perhaps some part of the brain detects such situations (e.g. to be able to avoid
them and in this way to improve one’s position in a prehistoric community).
And it looks like by doing impro I learned to turn off (or ignore)
such thoughts related towards me. However, I still get them towards others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-bad&quot;&gt;Is this bad?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, there are multiple ways to interpret that question, I see a couple options
(but the answer to all of the variations is still - no).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, when you get such thoughts, then you are on the boundary of your
comfort zone and something unusual and interesting must be happening.
I consider this positive. Imagine all people around you behaving “normally”,
such that you never get such thoughts. That would be extremely boring.
For everyone. Basically, when you get negative thoughts, you must be in 
a situation with increased “variance” and “amplitude”. Such situations
can lead you to unexpected ideas, which you would not discover yourself.
I think this is one of the main parts of impro - experiencing something,
which you would not be able to experience on your own. Basically, having 
a thought “Wow, I couldn’t imagine this developing this way, but now I do
enjoy it enormously”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, is the fact that you get these reactions bad by itself?
Nope. This is somewhat outside of our control. We’ve been impacted by
society, traditions and norms our entire life. As long as you can
hold them inside, everything is fine! Just remind yourself that you
were doing crazy stuff as well and let it got!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy impro with crazy situations but few negative reactions!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Improvisational theatre&quot;]" /><category term="impro" /><category term="reflection" /><summary type="html">I’ve been doing impro for quite some time now, however, I still often get disapproving reactions in my mind when others do something.

I again felt like making an overview of responses. Thus, here it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the general description of these experiments, see 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-6-unpopular-opinions&quot;&gt;my last post-response&lt;/a&gt;.
I previously did &lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-overview-projects-when-fire&quot;&gt;an overview&lt;/a&gt;
for the experiment #5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main goal here is to try see whether there are any peculiar similarities and differences.
This is also a good excuse to read all the responses (otherwise I would not find time for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it is just interesting. I still remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://awaytoless.com/thought-experiment-5/&quot;&gt;“A Way to Less”&lt;/a&gt;
goal to learn to handstand from the previous overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment official page is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/unpopular-opinion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
You can find links to posts in the Notes section below. I will refer to people by their twitter username for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the group happened to be very diverse and majority of opinions were mentioned only once.
Therefore, this time I will just describe my observations and highlights without making a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common unpopular opinion was FIRE or something related (@SavingNinja, @financeyourfire, @FretfulFinance, @merely_curious_).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both @TheIndeedably and @DrFIREUK didn’t like peer-to-peer landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For @asimple_life and @merely_curious_ (i.e. me) there happened to be almost a bingo situation.
Both of us happen to consider alcohol unnecessary (thus, don’t drink as much as others normally do)
and think that the society affects other people lives too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@SavingNinja believes that doing more yourself makes one happier. @TFSRetireEarly suggests, on the other hand, that
people should DIY less and it is overrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was peculiar to read responses of Andy and James from Rebo. They took different sides of the same
argument - whether one should be altruistic and how moral this is. The posts resembled a light duel or a debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@SavingNinja has touched relationships a bit. The opinion is to split expenses 50/50 in a relationship.
@FretfulFinance went all in on a relationship path. She never had a relationship, does not want to live 
with someone else, does not like weddings (but not anti-marriage), does not want children and does not
like public displays of affection. The post felt very personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were all the matches and below are remaining unique opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@MoneyModernGirl finds Italy too traditional and welcomes more innovation and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@financeyourfire believes in crypto currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@TheIndeedably has multiple unpopular opinions and presented a compilation of them: simpler tax code, more efficient social security,
one should own wealth generational assets, leverage is good, P2P landing is bad, innovation is slowing,
luck plays a large part in life (especially health), nothing really matters (we will be dead anyway), life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@ditchthecave believes that our appearance affects our lives more than we think. Also everything can be learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. @awaytoless finds electric cars not so environmentally friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. @awaytoless reminds us that we are not entitled to anything and feeling so can even have negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@DrFIREUK suggests to invest in equities, pay more attention to personal finance, avoid credit card debt and P2P investing. 
For them early retirement is not a goal (they plan to work). Also the last season of Game of Thrones was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@fi_left finds public ownership better than private. In other words, we need more parks, libraries,
free health care and good public transport instead of buying something for yourself for your short term happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@TFSRetireEarly believes in no free market. Also not everyone can become FIRE. One can beat the market and win money
by gambling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I my notes from what I read.
I have no clue why you would like to read this,
but I don’t see any harm in putting them here either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saving-ninja&quot;&gt;Saving Ninja&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/unpopular-opinion&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SavingNinja&quot;&gt;twitter @SavingNinja&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thought experiment to take part in, since the topic was from Indeedably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird one in private (reading, FIRE), with some quirks leaking externally (money saving tips guy at work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matched betting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being into FIRE is already weird, but let’s not focus on this, since majority of readers are into it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belief that “spending less makes you happier”, e.g. outsourcing to a bread maker instead of doing it with your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting expenses 50/50 with one’s partner independently of income difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-indeedably-&quot;&gt;{ in·deed·a·bly }&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indeedably.com/against-the-tide/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheIndeedably&quot;&gt;twitter @TheIndeedably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressing disapproval at board members meeting showing that an approach won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to the experiment is “peer”.
If you don’t care about someone’s opinion, they are not your peer.
As a result, you can have very small peer group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to live in a society where one can have and even express unpopular opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our opinions can be used to other parties for their own benefit (e.g. through media).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax code should be simple (a single-sided sheet of A4). All income should be taxed the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better social security. Evaluate the actual need for social security (e.g. whether one has
assets to sell). If the money are needed urgently (before being able to sell an asset), the
help should be a loan. Free education and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Own wealth generating assets (i.e. work for your own wealth instead of someone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leverage is good (if used correctly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer lending is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is slowing (and goes backwards in some areas due to short term views).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luck plays a large part (especially in one’s health).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really matters (you will be dead anyway). Deadlines are arbitrary.
Stress is mostly self inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is pretty good. It could be so much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t share their REALLY unpopular opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you look matters and impacts how successful you are in life. But the “good look” is defined by the culture and society itself and
changes with time. There is “beauty premium” (physical beauty affects wages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything can be learned (i.e. natural ability is a myth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can do anything, but you can’t do everything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric cars aren’t environmentally friendly. The batteries can have negative effects.
Power generation still can be environmentally unfriendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not entitled to anything. Feeling entitled affects your work - why working for something if you “have” a right for it? 
People feel entitled to start a family even when their financial position is nut suited for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We [Mr and Mrs Way] are entitled to be treated fairly. However, we have to remind ourselves that this is not a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about “peers” is good, because with “people in general” answering the question would be impossible.
Estimate rarity by remembering anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I should not drink alcohol aka there is no point in alcohol” (only 2 peers share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRE is good (only 1 peer shares).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Average” opinions in society are often wrong and one should treat them less seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age agnosticity when it comes to communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of me wants to be an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The room” - because the movie is so bad, it is actually good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going against the grain just for the sake of it makes no sense, instead you should believe into something and have strong character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an outlier is relative to the group you compare with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My FIRE plans make me an outlier when compared to my work colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in crypto currency. This does not fit the general FIRE narrative well (too risky).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Pay attention to personal finance (e.g. seek the best deals, get sign up bonuses)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Avoid credit card debt&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Avoid P2P&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Early retirement is not a goal (i.e. continue working after FI)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to drink alcohol when I was a teenager.
You don’t have to drink alcohol to have good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People struggle to challenge peer pressure to conform to the unwritten rules of society.
If you want to reach FIRE, you need to learn not to follow the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy is too traditional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italians live off their country and have no innovation and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a black market in Italy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;people reporting incomes of less than 20,000 euros (about $26,000) per year cumulatively own 188,000 supercars, 
(such as Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, or BMW coupes), 518 private airplanes or helicopters, and some 42,000 yachts.”

&lt;p&gt;A dilemma which topics to choose and how open to be when writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retirement planning could be an option, but readers enjoy it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political views (slightly left)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing details about relationship history feels much harder than personal finance numbers (even though the blog is anonymous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never had a relationship (early 30s) and wouldn’t be surprised to never have one.
Hard to imagine living together with the other person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t like wedding, but not anti-marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t like public displays of affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t want children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t understand obsession with sex and can live without ever having it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a relationship is dictated by the popular culture (music, films, TV).
I actually preferred to be alone (but it took time to understand this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50% preferring being single, 40% happy to wait and see if something comes along and 
10% actively wanting a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10% above are coming from the fear of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I manage to form a long-term relationship, I would ideally live close but separately.
In practice, I could imagine moving in for financial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marriage can be good for tax purposes and to show one’s commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a wedding itself is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not an asexual, rather the attraction is rarely strong enough to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;left-fi&quot;&gt;Left FI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leftfi.home.blog/2019/06/15/my-unpopular-opinion-public-is-better/&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fi_left&quot;&gt;twitter @fi_left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public ownership is better than private. One can buy something to maximize their short term happiness. 
At the same time, the public sphere (library, park, free health care, public transport) improves life a lot too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Altruism is not self-evidently morally good/necessary. Rather, people act in ways that
appear to be self-sacrificial only when it benefits them (even if that benefit is just making them feel ‘good’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altruism - acting in such a way that seems to harm your own self interest in order to benefit somebody else’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As someone on the path to financial independence, or who has achieved financial independence,
you are in an enormously privileged position, and positions of privilege like that come with
increased responsibility for helping others who are less fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person with more independence in how they spend their time, or with more money, has a larger
duty to help others than someone with fewer resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no free market and the ones we have are highly inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The favorite argument is that advertisement industry is meant to prevent rational buyers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randomthoughts.fyi/2014/04/free-market-vs-capitalism-what-is-free.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Another one is absence of the perfect information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can become FIRE (e.g. some people already live frugal enough to have no room for downscaling and no money to save).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible for one to beat the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t DIY everything (trying to do it once yourself is sufficient).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can win money gambling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Thought experiments&quot;]" /><category term="thought experiment" /><category term="overview" /><summary type="html">Saving Ninja had a new thought experiment recently (#6, about unpopular opinions).
