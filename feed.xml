&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pheromone-effects&quot;&gt;Pheromone effects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many pheromones are breakdown products of sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women preference for the smell of males gets more dramatic around the time of ovulation
(and they become more sensitive to this smell as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men rate women sweat generally unpleasant, but it is the least unpleasant around ovulation.
The same for pheromones (but testosterone dependent phenomenon) - men prefer pheromones derived from women
around ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wellesley effect - ability of females to synchronize each other cycles (this is done via pheromones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rodents, smell of an adult female delays onset of puberty of younger females (gene competition).
For males, the effect depends on the relative ranks of males involved. When smelling higher rank male,
the lower rank male testosterone levels can go down (again gene competition mechanism). In some species,
this leads to sudden burst of sperm production instead (counter strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female’s puberty can occur faster due to male smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can induce ovulation via sensory stimuli in some species, e.g. pigs. 
One can buy ovulatory pheromone - boarmate. The same pheromones are found in truffles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a paper from anonymous author, which looked at author’s testosterone levels (male) when
close to their significant other and in other city. Facial hair growth was used as a proxy.
After shaving, the author weighted stubble. The result was a step function with high levels
when close to significant other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level of relatedness has impact on all these pheromone based effects. E.g. when a male smells his sister,
no testosterone increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these mechanisms under different sexual orientation work like in an opposite gender. E.g. homosexual men prefer
other men smell (and the more testosterone the donor has, the stronger the preference is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animals can lick each other private parts (e.g. dogs, giraffe) to get more info via pheromones via
gustatory channel (i.e. taste).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human female voices get a little bit higher around ovulation (auditory priming) and this is 
detectable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these effects are subliminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impacts-on-libido&quot;&gt;Impacts on libido&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To drive down libido, terrify individual. 
Fear and extreme rage suppress reproductive behavior as well as chronic stress.
Short term stress can stimulate (e.g. in males, e.g. during warfare leading to
violent sexual behaviors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coolidge effect - take sexually sated male (i.e. he decided that he mated enough),
put him together with a different female and he will start mating again.
Variety is simulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-term-hormonal-impact&quot;&gt;Long term hormonal impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In species which ovulate at a specific time of the year, proceptive female behavior 
highly depends on whether they ovulate. In such species, likelihood to have sex
is almost a step function around ovulation. In non-human primates this is
like a smoothed-out step function, i.e. with softer edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In humans it is similar, but there is a second peak around 28th day of the cycle.
This can be explained by females worrying less of unwanted pregnancy.
Likelihood to have orgasm follows the same shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In women sexual arousal increases around time of ovulation. They act a bit differently
in terms of proceptive signaling around the time of ovulation. E.g. wear more provocative
clothing (as assessed by both men and women).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/cycle_effects_on_tips.pdf&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Miller et al (Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers:
economic evidence for human estrus)&lt;/a&gt;
about impact of ovulation on lap dancers tips. The tips were larger (335$ for 5 hours vs 
260$ during luteal phase vs 185$ during menstruation phase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is achieved via estrogen increase of receptors for progesterone
(i.e. brain gets more sensitive to progesterone and this increases
rewarding aspects of sex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also oxytocin is synthesized, which makes women feel more affilative
with someone they had sex with around the time of ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estrogen also has effects on body - it becomes more sensitive to touch around ovulation.
Olfactory sensitivity increases too. All of this creates bias towards males around ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testosterone-in-males&quot;&gt;Testosterone in males.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For males - testosterone is the driving force.
However, there is only correlative evidence. When males mate (e.g. specific time of the year),
testosterone levels are higher. Over one’s life span testosterone levels reach peak around puberty
and from 30 cascade down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More sexually active men tend to have higher testosterone levels (correlative studies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a dramatic drop of testosterone when becoming a father (and increase of vasopressin,
i.e. bonding).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you castrate a hamster (i.e. remove testosterone), sexual activity drops, but not to 0
(residual sexual behavior).
When you reintroduce a normal level of testosterone, sexual activity goes back to normal.
The more sex experience an individual has before castration, the more residual
sexual behavior there will be (i.e. this is driven by social experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you reintroduce 10% or 200% of normal testosterone levels, sexual activity goes back to normal.
I.e. testosterone is necessary for sexual activity, but exact levels are not that important.
1000% level is supraphysiological (out of normal range) and leads to increase in sexual behavior
and arousal (e.g. when applying anabolic steroids for muscle mass). Body tries to downregulate
receptors in this case (this is only partially successful).
As we will see later, the same applies to aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, testosterone is playing a modulatory role. 
I.e. it sensitizes one towards stimuli, but not evocative of sexual arousal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;melatonin&quot;&gt;Melatonin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tells body what time of the year it is (based on amount of light).
One of driving forces for seasonal mating.
There is a smidgen of evidence in humans for seasonal mating variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact-of-early-life&quot;&gt;Impact of early life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perinatal factors - before birth. Prenatal - after birth. Postnatal - very early development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early experience is not about learning how to be sexual (these are fixed action patterns),
but for appropriate social context. Same will apply to aggression later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1950s there were studies about captive primates and consequences of growing up
in certain degree of social isolation. In therms of sex behavior, it was normal,
but in totally wrong context (e.g. towards towel or bowl of food or fully ignoring social dominance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were studies of Kibbutz communities - if you spend a lot of time with someone before age of 6,
you subliminaly stop treating them as a potential mate (like imprinting), but instead like a sibling,
i.e. pseudo kin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before people thought that early experience in life affects sex orientation.
There were 2 models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;absence of father figure model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neurotic mother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, currently there is no evidence for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prenatal-hormonal-effects&quot;&gt;Prenatal hormonal effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormones have so called organizational effects early in one’s life (i.e. on their brain and nervous system).
Later they have activation effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rodents there are massive organizational effects.
E.g. if female rhesus monkey fetus is affected by testosterone, this masculinizes their brain.
If later in life there are no other impact, this has no effect.
However, when testosterone is injected later in life, she exhibits male fixed action patterns.
This is another example of “if-then” clause - iff masculinized brain, testosterone has effect.
In all other variations (i.e. testosterone on not masculinized brain or no testosterone with masculinized brain)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In humans androgenization of females can happen too:
E.g. due to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;congenital adrenal hyperplasia (overactive adrenal system)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drug in 1950s - diethylstilbestrol (DES). In some cases fetus body converted 
this to androgens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to higher chances of becoming a lesbian in adulthood.
However, the mechanism may be not obvious. E.g. androgenized female
has intersexual genitals. They have to go through re-constructive
plastic surgeries. This can affect the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testosterone-mechanism&quot;&gt;Testosterone mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testosterone can be converted to estrogen inside cell (intracellular phenomenon,
one needs special enzyme for this conversion).
This conversion happens e.g. in brain.
In genitals and gender-specific skin parts testosterone is converted to DHT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not all female fetuses get androgenized (since their mother body has estrogen)?
There is a special protein (alpha fetoprotein) during pregnancy which binds estrogen 
and degrades it. I.e. the only fetuses that have estrogen inside their neurons
are males and estrogen comes from testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already mentioned testicular feminized males before. Phenotypically a girl, but
does not hit puberty, no menstruation. In the end she happens to be a testicular feminized male.
The individual is chromosomally male and has underdeveloped testis. This is caused by mutation
in testosterone receptor. Sexual identification is female, but the body has
masculinized organization effects. As a result, the individual is just like a normal woman,
who can’t get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;genes&quot;&gt;Genes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genes determine which gonads you make as a fetus and gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain degree of heritability for sex orientation.
E.g. in twin studies - a given mono-zygotic twin has 50% chance to be homosexual if other twin is 
homosexual. For dizygotic it is 22%, for sibling - 9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean Hamer had a paper about genetic markers for sexual orientation.
Media immediately screamed about “the gay gene”.
However,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this is not a gene, but a genetic marker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is no consistency, each pair of siblings have this marker in a different location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this was never replicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belief that sexual behavior is for the good of species is wrong as we discussed in previous lectures.
There was a belief that sexual behavior is about reproduction, but there are plenty of examples
of non-reproductive sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. bonobo chimps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no sexual dimorphism (-&amp;gt; low degree of aggression)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;female dominance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a lot of sex -&amp;gt; the most sexually promiscuous species on Earth. Majority non-reproductive:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;no ovulation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;same gender&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sexual behavior which traditionally doesn’t result in eggs getting fertilized&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For them it is about promoting group cohesion, e.g. other species do
social grooming for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pregnancy-cost-asymmetry&quot;&gt;Pregnancy cost asymmetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperm does not cost a lot, but for females more effort is involved - eggs, pregnancy, postnatal care.
As a result, females are more selective who to mate with.
Usually the males are not selective in the slightest.
Exception - pair bonding species. There male can invest even more calories into a kid
(e.g. by carrying it around). This can create cuckoldry from female side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;males-controlling-female-reproductive-behavior&quot;&gt;Males controlling female reproductive behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males can control female reproductive behavior (mate guarding) as a competition with other males.
In human e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clitoridectomies (making sex less pleasant)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chastity belts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only in groups where males disappear for long periods of time (e.g. nomadic pastoralists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In animals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;copulatory plugs - semen plug hardens in vagina&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;barbed penis in flies, which male leaves (they can make a new one)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sperm competition - when mating, male biochemically decreases female sexual attractiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monogamous species have small amounts of sperm and small testis. Polygamous - large testis.
Chimps have gigantic testis when compared to body size. Humans are in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Females have counter strategies. E.g. hidden ovulation.
This is useful to decrease paternal certainty, competitive infanticide
and effectiveness of control over female (less clear when to actually control).
There can also be pseudo estrus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male-male competition for reproductive success is the leading cause of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternative-mating-strategies&quot;&gt;Alternative mating strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was believed that rank of a male predicts reproductive success (i.e. if there is N females,
N the most dominant males get to mate) - so-called linear model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is female choice (arguments against linear model).
In tournament species, males are physically able to dominate the female.
However, she can e.g. exhaust the male. E.g. walk when he tries to eat or sleep
or bring him to his worst rival. When they start fighting - run away and have
“stolen copulation” with the guy she is interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female baboons prefer baboons who are nice to them (suggestion, no strong proofs).
E.g. the ones who groom them a lot, play with infants, don’t beat them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Smuts coined a term of inter-sexual friendship in nonhuman primates based on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stolen copulations is a viable strategy for males. You don’t get injured by being top dominant male.
you live longer and, thus, have more cases of stolen copulations.
This is an alternative strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In orangutans, the alternative strategy for low ranking males is to mate against female will (i.e. rape).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low ranking male fish can pretend to be female and eventually mate with female.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Human Sexual Behavior - part 2.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Account fee on Flatex ⇒ Flatex alternatives</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/flatex-account-fee-and-alternatives" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Account fee on Flatex ⇒ Flatex alternatives" /><published>2020-01-11T09:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-11T09:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/flatex_account_fee_and_alternatives</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/flatex-account-fee-and-alternatives">&lt;p&gt;Recently Flatex shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://konto.biw-bank.de/formularcenter_bank/public/1300100.pdf&quot;&gt;an updated price PDF&lt;/a&gt;
for the new year and to my surprise there will be
an account fee starting from March. Since I have originally chosen Flatex to avoid percentage based fees
(because they &lt;a href=&quot;/post/underestimating-ter&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/a&gt; FIRE), it is the time to move away.
Let’s look where I will move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually was a great fan of Flatex. In the world, where almost all German brokers take at least 0.25% of your
transaction value, having a constant fee is a great. I definitely don’t want to give away 0.25% or 0.5% (once for buying,
once for selling) of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
my networth. This was the deciding point for me when going for Flatex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it looks like the constant fee model Flatex has chosen is actually not sustainable. They have negative
interest rate on cash since ages, but one could avoid it pretty easily by moving cash fast. Their fee structure
is a bit weird for active trading (it is super expensive, especially for non European stock exchanges). Thus,
they have likely attracted mostly ETF investors with buy &amp;amp; hold strategy. If one buys once a month, Flatex can’t
get more than 100 EUR per year from such a user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changes&quot;&gt;Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Flatex decided to change this and announced the news
right before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;degiro&quot;&gt;Degiro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatex bought Degiro. Surprise, surprise. 250M EUR (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatex.com/fileadmin/fintech_relaunch/Public/pdf/news/2019/pm/Press_Release_flatex_to_buy_degiro.pdf&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fees&quot;&gt;Fees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yearly depot fee of 0.1% (pre-VAT).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additional 2 EUR per transaction fee for some exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VAT in Germany is 19%, thus, for each 100k EUR invested or cash with Flatex, one will have to pay 119 EUR per year.
This is not the end of the world, but unpleasant. If one has 100k EUR with them now and plans to FIRE (i.e. to hold
the assets with them for 30 or more years), they may easily pay around 3k EUR in yearly fees. This is not a show stopper for FIRE,
but just giving away 3k EUR is unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the increased per transaction fee, this does have that much impact. If one buys once a month, it is 24 EUR
per year. During FIRE, one can sell once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the new fees affect also Degiro, current Degiro clients will be &lt;em&gt;very happy&lt;/em&gt;. I personally never used Degiro,
but their fees were much lower than Flatex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives&quot;&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mind spending my time and moving away from Flatex to save 3k EUR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My criteria are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No depot fee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The broker should be doing German taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideally no percentage based fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-brokers&quot;&gt;Interactive Brokers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have an account with IB and pretty happy with them (assuming that you have 100k USD with them to avoid monthly fee
of 10 USD, it
ends up cheaper than even old Flatex pricing). However, they don’t do German taxes. I am pretty sure
that I will be able to figure our Vorabpauschale, but having an example from a broker
would make the process much simpler. For such taxes example, I don’t even mind having a German broker with percentage based buying fee (since I don’t have to buy anything, I can just keep some
assets there, but buy at IB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dkb&quot;&gt;DKB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already did &lt;a href=&quot;/post/german-brokers-overview&quot;&gt;an overview of German brokers&lt;/a&gt; and somehow
I completely missed that DKB technically has somewhat constant transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dok.dkb.de/pdf/plv_pk.pdf&quot;&gt;Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, they take 10 EUR for an order up to 10k EUR and 25 EUR for larger orders.
This does not include stock exchange fees (e.g. Fremdkosten). 
The price jump at 10k EUR is weird, it may be that splitting e.g. 20k EUR transaction in two
will save money on the transaction fee (depends on stock exchange fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 EUR is actually quite pricey. If I were with a broker taking 0.25% transaction fee,
I would need to perform 4 kEUR transaction to pay 10 EUR fee there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have saving plans and one contribution to a saving plan costs 1.5 EUR.
One can have multiple saving plans, modify them frequently. They are executed only 
once per month on a specific day. The resulting ETFs are just like normal, the only
difference is that one chooses EUR amount, not number of shares, thus, you end up
with fractional shares. Looks like selling “saving plans” follows the rules above.
Theoretically one should be able to move their depot to a broker with cheapest
selling feels before their retirement to mitigate selling fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there is no depot fee (at least so far).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have free depot transfer. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dkb.de/info/depotwechselservice/&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; to fill in
and to sent to the old broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peculiar that they used to give 0.2% per year interest for up to 100k EUR for Aktivkunden.
To become an active client, one needs to receive at least 700 EUR per month.
Since 2020, the interest rate will be only 0.01%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since DKB is also a bank, it makes sense to consider their bank benefits. Active clients don’t
pay 1.75% fee when paying in non-EUR currency (this only true for their Visa Credit Card, not Master Card).
This actually looks attractive, since I occasionally
need to pay in non-EUR and both Deutsche Bank and Ing have similar 1.75% fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;smsTan costs 0.07 EUR per SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;onvista&quot;&gt;OnVista&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can open an account here only if they are a citizen of Germany, France, Ireland, Luxembourg,
Austria or Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onvista-bank.de/files/dokumente/formulare/formularcenter/020.1-5EUR-festpreis-preis-leistungsverzeichnis.pdf&quot;&gt;Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 + 2 EUR per transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying for savings plan is 1 EUR pro transaction. Transaction volume is limited - from 50 EUR to 500 EUR.
Selling is considered an ordinary transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The account is free for existing clients. For new clients, there is a 0.5% yearly fee for amount over
250k EUR. Funny fact, the PDF says that Depot-/ Kontoführung is free (with a small note that “there is a fee
over 250k EUR, see the following section for details”). However, it looks like this affects only cash. The
original quote is [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onvista-bank.de/files/dokumente/formulare/formularcenter/020.1-5EUR-festpreis-preis-leistungsverzeichnis.pdf&quot;&gt;source, page 6, note 2&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zur Berechnung des Verwahrentgelts ermittelt die onvista bank den täglichen Saldo der Euro-Sichteinlagen auf Kontobasis. Hiervon wird der Freibetrag von 250.000,- Euro pro Konto subtrahiert. Ein positiver Restsaldo wird anschließend mit dem von der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) für die Einlagenfazilität jeweiligen tagesgültigen vorgegebenen Zinssatz multipliziert, sofern dieser Zinssatz negativ ist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sichteinlagen” is “checking account”. Looks like they try to forward negative interest rates from European Central Bank 
to the clients (i.e. it costs money OnVista to store your cash when interest rates are negative). Thus, this is not the end of the world. If I were you, I would definitely double check with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this fee was to include stocks, this would be a party stopper for me for sure.
In terms of FIRE, 250k EUR is pretty reachable. At 312.5k EUR this would become
even more expensive than Flatex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade-republic&quot;&gt;Trade Republic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New broker, which I haven’t even seen before. Looks like a “let’s disrupt everything” startup 
similar to Robinhood in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free orders (when not taking into account stock exchange fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do your German taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like they have a limited set of ETFs and stocks. Their website says 7800 stocks and ETFs.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solarisbank.com/blog/interview-how-trade-republic-is-revolutionizing-stock-trading/&quot;&gt;This interview&lt;/a&gt;
with the founder mentions 500 ETFs. It is also mentioned that they have 25 employees and 10M EUR investment
round (the article was written in July 2019). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trade-republic#section-overview&quot;&gt;Crunchbase&lt;/a&gt;
gives 17M EUR as total funding amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Republic looks attractive, but I am scared to put a sizable chuck of my FIRE portfolio there.
My timeline is very long. I agree that these folks are doing a great thing, but I am not yet
convinced that they will still exist in a couple years. This is a startup with 2 rounds of investment.
This is very early for a startup. Moreover, Robinhood has plenty of problems in the US (e.g.
the latest infinite margin bug). Disruptiveness of startups in brokerages - no, thank you!
Moreover, the set of ETFs to buy is currently limited (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/dp9mtk/place_to_buy_etfs_and_stocks_traderepublic_any/&quot;&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;
mentions only iShares ETFs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OnVista has citizenship limitations and presumably cash depot fee starting from 250k EUR.
I am worried that it may become “non-cash” too. 250k are reachable for a FIRE person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like DKB is the only option with constant buying/selling fees at this stage.
Unfortunately, their fees are quite large. Thus, one may prefer to bundle investments into 
10k EUR chunks or tinker with their saving plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already started opening DKB account. I will wait with the move until Flatex 
sends me Tax report for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep you posted with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If DKB introduces depot fee, I will then consider moving to a broker with non-constant transaction fees,
but won’t buy there anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-pointers&quot;&gt;Further pointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;r/Finanzen on Reddit has multiple related threads (mostly in German), e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/eeiyxe/flatex_wird_uninteressant_dkb_oder_onvista/&quot;&gt;DKB or OnVista when moving from Flatex?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, many people will leave Flatex and quite a few will land at DKB.
This can still be financially positive for Flatex - they may get more money in the end with 
fewer clients left (the ones who are ok with the new fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to look at a behavior. First to consider its fixed action patterns. Then step back and look at origins
for this behavior, i.e. what happened in the brain &amp;amp; environment, its stimulus. All of these at different
time scales - 1 second ago, 1 minute and up to millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a proximal mechanism for sexual behavior - it feels good (driven by sensory stimuli,
feedback and sensations). In species with only reproductive sex, pleasure depends 
on ovulation. In humans it is different (but it is still easier when estrogen levels are higher).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many species have similar fixed action patterns, e.g. lordosis reflex, pelvic thrusting, orgasm,
ejaculation. At the same time there are differences across species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed action patterns create chains of behavior:
1) Fixed action pattern of individual A is a releasing stimuli for individual B.
2) Resulting fixed action pattern of B is a releasing stimuli for individual A.
3) Loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates species specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, ethological approach is essential when studying sexual behavior.
E.g. studying female rat sexual behavior in a cage is like studying dolphin swimming in a bathtub.
In case of a female rat, there was a large belief that the role of a female rat was very passive. However,
this was caused by the cage and lack of space to run around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying in people - anonymous surveys or something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response&quot;&gt;randomized response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libido was used before, but it is now outdated. Instead in the literature one uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;attractivity (how attractive an individual is)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proceptivity (active behaviors being carried out in response to being attracted to that individual)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;receptivity (how receptive a given individual to the interest of others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow is the following. Because of attractiveness of individual A, individual B began proceptive 
behaviors, which did or did not prove to meet receptive fixed action patterns of A in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;female-orgasm&quot;&gt;Female orgasm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is present not only in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fertility does not depend on female orgasm. 
Thus, it is not necessary to increase number copies of your genes.
However, it may facilitate fertilization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;orgasm increases vaginal secretion and vaginal fluid increases sperm motility (indirect evidence)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;orgasm exhausts - a female lays horizontally - sperm does not have to swim against gravity 
(leading model)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it feels good, thus, positive reinforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, no connection between fertility and female propensity towards orgasm was observed.
There is a certain degree of heritability of propensity towards orgasm in females.
Likelihood of female orgasm depends more on a female than on a male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clitoral-orgasm&quot;&gt;Clitoral orgasm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can be spandrel - baggage from male ejaculation.
E.g. nipples are spandrels in men (women have to go through lactation, it is “expensive” to evolve
men without nipples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sexual-behavior-unique-to-humans&quot;&gt;Sexual behavior unique to humans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of behavior which are falsely believed to be unique to humans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-reproductive sex (bonobo, chimps, dolphins)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreplay (bonobo, chimps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homosexuality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quest for variety (bonobo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confusion with violence (psychopathological)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Masturbation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fantasy (baboons)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Egalitarian sex&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private setting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marriage. &amp;gt; 90% of human end up in stable relationship even across polygamous cultures. However, there is 
a lot of social monogamy, but less of sexual monogamy. In Western countries 10-40% of all children in marriage
are not from marriage husband. Note: I tried to find a proof (since this looked like a lot) and there is at
least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-paternity-myth-the-rarity-of-cuckoldry&quot;&gt;one article&lt;/a&gt;
mentioning 1-5% range instead, which feels more plausible to me. The number is hard to estimate, since fathers
who doubt their paternity are more likely to do the test. Thus, the rate can reach 10-40% if you just consider
rate at paternity testing laboratories (which is not a good proxy for general population).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Romance. Couple centuries old concept. The notion that it should last through relationship is only 30-50
years old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somewhat boring - no sex changes, not hermaphrodites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average duration of a marriage is 2-4 years, which is close to average inter-birth period
and for how long children critically depend on parents.
Thus, humans tend to be serial monogamists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;neurobiology&quot;&gt;Neurobiology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limbic system is responsible for fixed action patterns.
Different areas are relevant for different genders.
In case of female:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subsection of hypothalamus (HT). Here is a ventral medial (VMH) - hot spot for receptors for
estrogen and progesterone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midbrain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spinal pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medial preoptic area in HT responsible for performing. Here are receptors for testosterone &amp;amp; androgen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amygdala (sexual motivation). Thus, males confuse sexuality with aggression.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autonomic nervous system for erection (clitoral erections in females work like that too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-erection-mechanisms&quot;&gt;Types of erection mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be vascular or muscular. Vascular is based on blood flowing in and not flowing out and lasts longer.
Muscular is based on a muscle and occurs faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dimorphism-across-genders&quot;&gt;Dimorphism across genders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a similar orgasm physiology across sexes, but recovery time is different (slower for females).
E.g. for males too fast transition from parasympathetic system to sympathetic leads to premature ejaculation.
For females a failure of transition leads to inability to reach orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain also has areas, which differ across sexes, e.g.
INAH cluster in hypothalamus. Size 2:1 for men:women. One can almost identify gender by size of this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hormonal-response&quot;&gt;Hormonal response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In females having sex leads to increase of progesterone derived hormones (i.e. reinforcing pleasure).
Also without adrenal glands sexual motivation and arousal goes down in females (i.e. androgens play a role).
Oxytocin is responsible for forming attachments and pair bonds. Higher level of oxytocin leads to more trust
and cooperation (even when sprayed through nose). Neuromarketing is very interested in such topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally oxytocin is used for nursing and milk. As a result, monogamous attachment is a descendant of
neurobiology of mother-offspring attachment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For males - testosterone goes up after sex. There is no evidence for higher testosterone causing more sex activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasopressin is responsible for forming pair bonds.
Monogamous species have receptors for vasopressin on dopamine releasing neurons.
More such receptors, the faster pair bonds can be produced.
Similar in monkeys.
Humans are as usual somewhere in between on this mono-poly scale, but there are 
genetic variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mechanism is not fully understood, e.g. bonobos have monogamous receptors, but they are
hyper polygamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sexual-orientation&quot;&gt;Sexual orientation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was mentioned above, INAH area differs across genders. 
However, homosexual men have size of this area similar to hetero women.
This was discovered in a study by Simon Levay and has been replicated.
However, the brains were from AID victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also hypothalamus difference. Dr. Schwab published this and 
even got death treats from homosexual community, since this was perceived
as pathology. Levay was gay and his finding was met much better.
Partially since its connection to gender and sexuality was better understood.
This hypothalamus area just happened to be close to the area Levay discovered
(i.e. its size difference is caused by proximity to and INAH size difference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, INAH study was perceived positively, since it was showing
that orientation can not be chosen, but it is just a biology instead.
There was even a t-shirt “the only small thing about me is my sexually dimorphic nucleus” (i.e. INAH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a difference in ratio of length of 2nd finger vs 4th. Homosexual men on average tend to have 
this ratio close to straight women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otoacoustic reflex. If you close your ears, you hear oscillations and their rate differs by sex.
Homosexual men have frequency more typical of straight women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For homosexuality in women there are fewer studies. The 2nd/4th finger ratio is the same (i.e.
homosexual women have ratio of straight men) as well as otoacoustic reflex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trans-sexuality&quot;&gt;Trans-sexuality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used to be a psychiatric disorder (as well as homosexuality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a gender difference in size of bed nucleus of the stria terminals (reliable predictor for gender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transsexuals have the size of their self identified gender (i.e. not their physical gender).
This holds even for people who didn’t do gender change.
Moreover when men with testicular cancer are treated with feminine hormones, this does not change
size of this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60% of victims of penile cancer have phantom penile sensations. Transgender people, who changed
their gender from male to female get no phantom penile sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, transsexuals got a wrong gender body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dopamine&quot;&gt;Dopamine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurobiology of pleasure, anticipation and reward is common. Role of dopamine is identical across genders
and is huge. Loss of sexual interest is one of defining symptoms of clinical depression.
Mesolimbic dopamine system is central to reinforcing aspects of sexual behavior.
It is about anticipation of the reward and fueling of behaviors needed to achieve reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In males this system activates, if one finds another person attractive and there is eye contact or
the other person is not attractive and there is no eye contact. Same holds for homosexual men looking 
at pictures of other men. Sexual orientation in this mechanism is just like having other gender areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is related to uncertainty. E.g. if a monkey gets reward only in 50% of cases,
the dopamine level will be even higher than when 100% reward.
This is called intermittent reinforcement. If the rate is changed to 25% or 75%,
the level falls, but still higher than 100% (i.e. corresponds to level of uncertainty).
Thus, the goal of Las Vegas is to convince people that there is 50% change, when there is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joke: relationship is the price you pay for anticipation of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonding&quot;&gt;Bonding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are receptor subtypes D1 and D2, which are relevant for sex behavior.
In monogamous rodents, when bonding happens level of D2 goes down and D1 increases.
If D2 falls before mating, no pair bond happens.
If decrease of D2 or increase of D1 is prevented, the individuals will bond with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2 - rewarding anticipatory aspects of pair bonding
D1 - pleasure of monogamous features of pair bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human ratio of D2/D1 predicts stability of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a brain imaging study which considered couples after 2.5 weeks and after 5 years.
In the first case, just seeing their beloved one activated this dopamine system.
In the second case, anterior cingulate was activated instead (i.e. empathy, comfort)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brain-areas&quot;&gt;Brain areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex is responsible for context of sexual behavior (i.e. how to be appropriate).
This does not change fixed action patterns, but their context instead.
Damage to this area can lead e.g. to a rape in a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stimuli&quot;&gt;Stimuli&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non human primates (as well as humans) are very visual (males usually more).
As a result, they get more dopamine activation due to visual stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some tactile receptors activate more dopamine, this explains erogenous zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsiveness to stimuli also depends on hormone levels.
In women, there is more sensitivity during ovulation (especially genitals).
Overall skin is more sensitive to sexually arousing touch during ovulation.
In men testosterone is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;olfactory&quot;&gt;Olfactory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are olfactory cues, i.e. pheromones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both sexes right hormones are required to generate pheromones.
Men with low testosterone don’t generate pheromones, neither do women without ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pheromones - breakdown products of sex hormones.
Neuromarketing is also interested in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfumes are classically made of sweat of various animals (typically male).
E.g. Chanel #5 was based on sweat of whipped male Abyssinian cats.
Currently it is more synthetic and made of androgens.
The sweat is from males, because majority of perfumes are not bought by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pheromones convey a lot of info, e.g. species, gender, whether castrated or not,
health, terrified or not, family-related to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perceive pheromones, the receiver needs right hormones, e.g. castrated men don’t
distinguish sweat of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Females identify gender via pheromones even better when they ovulate.
Homosexual men are even better at detecting other homosexual men smell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Human Sexual Behavior - part 1.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Overview of this blog’s life in 2019 and plans for 2020</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/blog-summary-2019" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Overview of this blog's life in 2019 and plans for 2020" /><published>2020-01-05T14:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-05T14:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/blog_summary_2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/blog-summary-2019">&lt;p&gt;I’ve got an idea to start a blog in the end of 2018 and published the first post
in the early January of 2019. In other words, this blog is now kind of one year old.
This was not my New Year resolution, but somehow it worked out.
Let’s reflect a bit, see some stats and what I am going to do differently in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I don’t remember precisely why I wanted to start this blog. It was probably an attempt
to express myself, see what other people find interesting. However, with time these intentions
mutated greatly. Currently I consider a blog as a nice lever for doing stuff I like.
When I have an idea, I can not only do it, but also write about it on the blog
and this increases the impact of my idea. Moreover, I do enjoy writing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposed-changes&quot;&gt;Proposed changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this blog is a living organism on its own and I constantly experiment
with my approach to it. And I definitely want to continue doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of 2019 I have adopted two posts per week schedule.
My hope was that this would make the blog more interesting to regular readers.
I also usually scheduled 1 hour per post for writing and ~30 minutes for after-baking
modifications (if you are confused by “baking”, I’ve described the process 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/how-i-write-this-blog&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). And as people often say -
“you get what you measure”. As a result, many of my posts are rather short and somewhat shallow.
I did do a couple posts which took much longer than allocated and I did enjoy working on them a lot
(e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;/post/luckiest-investor-or-investing-when-knowing-the-future&quot;&gt;luckiest investor&lt;/a&gt;).
Also it looked like others found such posts more interesting as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am going to try to have no schedule from now on.
As well as no time allocation per post. This means that I may “disappear” for longer,
but eventually come back with much deeper posts (and hopefully of better quality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way I hope to preserve the part of the blog which I like (writing deep posts
and exploring the topic well) and to get rid of less interesting parts (having to post something
twice a week). The former was always a pure flow. The latter definitely felt like a chore sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I somewhat implicitly used to optimize for quantity. Quality might
have been implicitly sacrificed. Again, this was all implicit, I just wanted regularity.
Now I will try to optimize for quality and very likely quantity will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expected-challenges&quot;&gt;Expected challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already see one possible issue with my new approach. 
I am quite a perfectionist and having strict deadlines helps me to fight that.
However, without a schedule, I might polish a post forever.
I am not sure how to counter that, perhaps some upper bound time limit
per post. In any case, I will try to split the posts into smaller chunks
and to publish them sooner this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics&quot;&gt;Topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope that the new approach will change topic allocation of my posts.
Due to allocated time limit in 2019 I often did write personal reflections on 
various topics. This is not bad per-se, but it is often very anecdotal,
doesn’t have any proof and not that rigorous. I hope that with the new approach
I will do more coding, simulations, deep rigorous posts with citations and
sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now let’s look back and see how 2019 went for this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started time tracking in March and overall I spent at least 120 hours since then.
This is clean time (i.e. just me actively doing something blog related) and might be a lower
bound. This also includes various non-writing activities, e.g. Jekyll related fixes, actually posting stuff,
updating twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this feels less than I expected.
Overall there were 76 posts in 2019, 8 of which were before March.
Thus, we are left with 68 posts in 120 hours or 1 hour 45 minutes per post.
Funny enough this matches very closely my time allocation of 1 hour for writing
and ~0.5 hour for after-baking corrections. Unfortunately, I don’t have time tracking with per 
post granularity, but I definitely remember that there was a lot of variation.
Some posts did take 7-10 hours (very few though), some more like 10-20 minutes.
After-baking fixes often took 5-10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now analyze the posts themselves and build various graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-counts&quot;&gt;Post counts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at posts published over day of week, we definitely see my chosen Tuesday - Sunday schedule.
Closer to the end of the year, I replaced Sunday with “weekend”, so that explains the Saturday’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/1_posts_per_day_of_week.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar plot of #posts published per day of week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking per month only October is unusual. Unfortunately I was traveling and didn’t have much chance to write.
It is peculiar to observe me ramping up in January and February and reaching steady state in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/2_posts_per_month.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar plot of #posts published per month&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at number of posts published per day for the entire year, we can definitely
see how I started with no schedule and then in March switched to 2 posts per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/3_posts_per_day.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar histogram #posts published per day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;characters-published&quot;&gt;Characters published&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity I just look at file sizes, which may be different from number of characters one observes
on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at average post size in characters per day of week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/4_average_characters_per_day_of_week.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar plot of average #characters per post per day of week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow magically Thursday happens to have the longest average post.
Actually there are only 2 posts on Thursdays - 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/underestimating-ter&quot;&gt;“Underestimating TER”&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-7-true-happiness&quot;&gt;“Thought experiment #7 about true happiness”&lt;/a&gt;
, both of which are 11-12k characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longest post is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;the review of “The science of wellbeing” course&lt;/a&gt;. 34411 characters, I am not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortest one is about &lt;a href=&quot;/post/interactive-brokers-monthly-fee&quot;&gt;interactive brokers monthly fee&lt;/a&gt;, 1657 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/book-summary-the-dip&quot;&gt;the summary of “The dip”&lt;/a&gt; with
7505 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at a histogram of post sizes, we can see that almost all posts are up to ~15k characters
with only few outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/5_post_sizes_histogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Histogram of post sizes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at characters published per day over entire year:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/6_characters_per_day.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar histogram #characters published per day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some variation, but nothing peculiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;words&quot;&gt;Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top 10 most common words with their occurrence counts (case sensitive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘to’ - 2970&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘the’ - 2749&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘and’ - 2028&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘a’ - 1940&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘is’ - 1925&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘I’ - 1815&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘of’ - 1715&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘you’ - 1358&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘in’ - 1278&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘this’ - 1161&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny that there is so much “I”, but fortunately “you” is not that far back.
This quite matches the general distributing in English (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000&quot;&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt;). There you get 1.94 “I” for each “you”, 
while in this blog it is 1.33. In other words, it is more about you than an average English text. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I suspect that I sometimes don’t use “the” where I should (the count is lower
than on average in English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notable mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘time’, 450 occurrences, rank 27 vs 69 in English&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘people’, 369, rank 40 vs 135&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘something’, 259, rank 63 vs 219 (I should try using this less frequently)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘FIRE’, 218, rank 69 vs 351 (for ‘fire’)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘life’, 206, rank 74 vs 114&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘money’, 159, rank 96 vs 271&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this illustrates well what this blog is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;popularity&quot;&gt;Popularity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post with the most unique pageviews is 
about &lt;a href=&quot;/post/interactive-brokers-fixed-vs-tiered-commissions&quot;&gt;fixed vs tiered Interactive Brokers commissions&lt;/a&gt;.
It also has the largest average time spent on the page.
Somehow people find this topic very interesting.
I myself was also confused by all the intricate details and that’s why I decided to write the post
in the first place. I definitely didn’t expect it to become that relatively popular.
It also gets the most interest in search engines and badly dominates all
search clicks and queries. What a peculiar world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runner up in unique pageviews is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/luckiest-investor-or-investing-when-knowing-the-future&quot;&gt;luckiest investor&lt;/a&gt;.
This one was peculiar and I did expect it to pique some interest.
This post also became my by far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmnbyb/the_luckiest_investor_of_2018_or_how_much_you/&quot;&gt;most popular post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;afterword&quot;&gt;Afterword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is 2019 for “Merely Curious”.
I am definitely looking forward to build similar graphs for 2020 after getting rid of publishing schedule.
There must be much less structure there and, thus, observations to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to you all for motivating me!
You are very welcome to contact me, I am definitely not overwhelmed
by reader communication at this point.
See my email and twitter below.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/merely_curious_&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; would do too if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s reflect a bit, see some stats and what I am going to do differently in 2020.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Human Behavioral Biology” - course summary (lecture 14)</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-14-limbic-system" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Human Behavioral Biology&quot; - course summary (lecture 14)" /><published>2019-12-21T13:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-12-21T13:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lecture_14_limbic_system</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-14-limbic-system">&lt;p&gt;Limbic System. Finally we get closer to emotions and this gets super interesting fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limbic system is a part of brain, which is involved in emotions, but does not get much interest e.g. in
medical schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rats olfactory bulb is a large part of the brain. Its signals are processed in limbic system. Rat’s emotional
world is driven by olfactory information. In birds it is more based on sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;triune-brain-model&quot;&gt;Triune brain model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ancient, archaic part. Hypothalamus talks to pituitary, so called reptilian part. It is responsible for purely
automatic regulation. E.g. monitors and controls temperature, blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ondine’s curse - stroke damage to this area. As a result no capacity for automatic breathing. Affected
person dies of sleep deprivation. One can’t fall asleep, because then they don’t breathe and get at
the edge of asphyxiation and wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[On top] Limbic system - mostly mammalian.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[On top] Cortex. Greatly expanded in primates and especially in humans. Cortex can be influenced by other two
systems or influence them (e.g. emotional/physiological response after thinking about future death).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subparts-of-limbic-system&quot;&gt;Subparts of limbic system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We say that parts are &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt;, when neurons located in that part have axons in the other part (i.e. this area
&lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; into the other area).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire limbic system is structured around how to influence hypothalamus. Each part tries to inhibit other parts
and tell hypothalamus what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fewer hops (synapses in-between) to hypothalamus some projection has, the better control that part has
(faster, neurons downstream don’t affect the signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olfactory system is the only system, which is only 1 synapse away from limbic system. All other sensory
systems have minimum 3 synapses (e.g. layer responsible for detecting dots and lines in visual signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amygdala - cluster of neurons. Means almond in Greek. Responsible for fear, anxiety, aggression. 
Thus, there is connection between fear and aggression. Also covers male sexual motivation. This partially explains
why one can confuse sex behavior and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Septum - inhibits aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypocampus - handles memory &amp;amp; turns off stress response. This combination (memory &amp;amp; stress) in one center is
important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;saving how you got away from a stress situation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when ending up in the same situation, retrieving how you fixed it last time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mammillary bodies - maternal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PFC - cortical component of limbic system. It is responsible for impulse control, postponing gratification,
long-term planning, learning appropriate sexual behavior, how not to be aggressive and when to be.
PFC is larger in humans (that’s what makes us humans). It is only recently evolved and
also the last part of the brain to fully mature (not fully myelinated until mid 20s).
Best predictor for ratio of PFC over entire brain is size of species social group. I.e. PFC is important
for gossip, social intelligence, appropriate behavior.
Part of PFC is anterior cingulate - empathy (related to clinical depression).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VFA - depression, release dopamine -&amp;gt; pleasure. All addictive drugs (e.g. cocaine) affect this area.
This activates when you anticipate getting pleasure (i.e. not getting the reward itself, but just
anticipation). As a result, this powers the behavior to get the reward.
Motivation for pursuing pleasure is more addictive than pleasure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothalamus - sexual behavior. Size depends on sexual orientation (e.g. transgender people have
configuration of self-identified gender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCN - circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PT - makes CRH, i.e. stress response. All other parts send projections here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LHT - hunger. Measures glucose and insulin in blood. Also hunger for other rewards than food, e.g. other types 
of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-to-study-limbic-system&quot;&gt;Ways to study limbic system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Evolution is not an inventor, it is a tinkerer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warfare is a good source of subjects for brain experiments (there are often casualties, which lead to removal
of parts of the brain). After a war, neuroscientists get their careers jump-started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. patient NA, who had their septum taken out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;N.A. has been amnesic since 1960 when at the age of 22 years he sustained a penetrating brain injury with a miniature fencing foil.
Source: Description of brain injury in the amnesic patient N.A. based on magnetic resonance imaging. Squire LR et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobotomy - “intentional” brain damage (e.g. cutting off limbic structures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray matter - nuclei, cell bodies, white matter - cables of axons wrapped in myelin (they do actually
have these colors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental animals - destroy part of the brain, look what does not work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put an electrode in a brain region and stimulate it (i.e. provide an input signal there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put a recording electrode and see when that area is excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is possible to record one neuron and even one ion channel of a neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way one can find out which parts of the brain send their signals into a particular area and how many
hops it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imaging brain regions (CT scan, CAT, MRI, functional brain imaging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hard to distinguish centers from fibers of passage. I.e. did one destroy a center responsible for some
function or a passage which carries this signal? One can imagine that we want to find out source
of garlic, that brings garlic to Stanford. And we can do this only by carpet-bombing. Eventually garlic
stops coming to the campus. Did we destroy the garlic farm or a highway?
Sometimes fibers can pass very close to nuclei (no way to destroy only one of them).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is a center in the brain? Everything is highly intermixed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to know your species (i.e. to know ethology). 
Let’s say you put stimulating electrode and observe a lion extending its claw.
When you do the same to a human, they start cursing. I.e. this is irritation
and lion just expressed it this way. Another example is a rat running around and
collecting pieces of a newspaper. When the same is done to a rhesus monkey,
it grabs something cylindrical and hugs it. This is nursing behavior.
It is also difficult to distinguish aggression from food acquisition (e.g. a rat attacking a mouse after
a stimulation). This can also vary across individuals even in the same species, e.g. in case of portraying dominance,
a subordinate won’t do power display (even when this area is stimulated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-lange-theory-of-emotion&quot;&gt;James-Lange theory of emotion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stimulus comes into brain. Before brain processes it, your body already responds (e.g. increased heart rate).
How do you figure out which emotion you feel? Your brain looks at changes in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an old experiment, where adrenalin was given to people without them knowing it (nowadays this
wouldn’t be allowed). Then people sit in waiting room. There is an accomplice. For one group,
the accomplice is pissed off. For another group - happy and friendly. People in the experiment
just overtook the emotion. I.e. adrenalin mediates emotion you socially observe. It does not cause
a concrete behavior, but exaggerates the emotional state provoked externally (i.e. like Gaba inhibition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, one can affect emotional state by affection body. E.g. when one is anxious, they get valium.
When one needs to relax muscles, they get something similar. I.e. to get rid of anxiety, one needs to relax,
since anxiety is based on feedback from muscle tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same with aggression. E.g. let’s say your significant other pissed you off. Then they apologize and you
accept the apology. Cognitively you have resolved the conflict, but your body is still in pissed off state.
It takes time to change the state. You can easily fall back into being angry due to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can work other way around, e.g. meditation &amp;amp; biofeedback for blood pressure control. One can find trigger
(e.g. a pleasant thought), which decreases blood pressure and by using it, make the effect even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a gender difference in how long it takes to get back to baseline (including after orgasm) - males
faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take someone in depression, force them to smile mechanically repetitively. Eventually they will start feeling better
due to this body-emotion feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peculiar motor system inefficiency. When you want to bend one particular finger, there is a system which
tells all 5 of them to bend. Then there is another system which tells other fingers: “if you receive command
‘bend’, ignore it”. This shows evolution of these systems. Many species don’t need to bend one finger, thus,
they have a system for bending all fingers (e.g. claw) at the same time. It was “easier” to add an add-on 
to allow bending one finger instead of redesigning everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some regions change size with time. Amygdala gets bigger in people with post traumatic stress disorder.
In people with long term major depression, hippocampus get smaller (atrophy).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Limbic System.

Basically we consider simplifications made during the last two
lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 3 last lectures, everything was very simple and smooth. Let’s now see ways in which everything is more
complex than it seemed (e.g. what was omitted, simplified).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuro and endocrine systems can change their function over time in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cells in pituitary gland are specialized (each produces only one hormone). However, they are mixed in terms
of location (i.e. not clustered). Moreover, how strongly a given cell reacts depends on its neighborhood.
Brain can use this to control the production better (i.e. target only specific cells in specific
neighborhood). This means that there is a communication across cells in pituitary to achieve the neighborhood
differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dales-laws&quot;&gt;Dale’s laws&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two of them, both have been disproved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: action potential of a neuron starts in its body and causes neurotransmitters to be released from every
single terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;False, you can get blockades, which prevent signal propagation in some branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: each neuron has one and only one characteristic type of neurotransmitter, that it releases through all
its terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are examples of multiple neurotransmitters in the same neuron. Peculiarly in this case every single axon terminal
contains both types of neurotransmitters (i.e. there is no division across axon terminals). There are even
examples of 3 neurotransmitters in one neuron. Usually one neurotransmitter has short effect and the other - long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple-ways-to-trigger-same-hormone-production&quot;&gt;Multiple ways to trigger same hormone production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACTH in pituitary gland can be produced due to receiving CRH or many other hormones. Brain can create different
mixtures of these. This affects the shape of ACTH production curve. It also has additional effects (i.e. not
only produces ACTH). There are also hormones inhibiting ACTH production. E.g. when one goes to sleep,
there is no need for stress hormones. Hormone profile released to produce ACTH during stress due to thinking
about “mortality” differs from stress when “burning big toe”. I.e. by having different “cocktails” the brain is
able to react differently to different stress situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quantity-regulation-feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Quantity regulation (feedback loops)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neuron&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autoreceptor - a receptor at the axon on the neuron, which binds the same neurotransmitter this neuron produces.
Every time the receptor binds something, neuron “concludes” “I released N neurotransmitter
units” (i.e. counts in a statistical way). This enables a negative feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hormones&quot;&gt;Hormones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain also measures how much of a specific hormone there is in blood. Thus, there must be brain areas counting specific
hormones. Then it can inhibit hormone production when there is enough of it (negative feedback loop). Most
feedback works by “the more of a given hormone I observe, the more I inhibit”, i.e. inhibition is proportional
to an absolute number. However, there are examples when a rate of change is measured instead. I.e. the 
faster the rate of change is, the stronger the inhibition is. In this case, increase from 10 to 12 &amp;amp;
from 10M to 12M cause the same level of inhibition. This happens at a level of pituitary gland, not brain.
Measuring rate of change is a non-obvious approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also examples of positive feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;autoregulation&quot;&gt;Autoregulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone constantly screams at you, you stop paying attention to them. Cells do the same to hormones.
If there is too much of some hormone, they decrease number of its receptors to become less sensitive.
This can happen when system fails. This may be related to depression, however people still don’t know whether
depressions is due to too much or too little serotonin (because the mechanism is so complex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diabetes&quot;&gt;Diabetes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You eat sugar, glucose ends up in blood. Pancreas secretes insulin to tell fat cells to capture sugar
from the blood. Fat cells are already full (due to western diet) and they can’t take more sugar, so they
ignore the signal. Pancreas secretes even more insulin to compensate. Fat cells decrease number of receptors.
You get a feedback loop. Fat cells become less and less sensitive and pancreas produces more and more insulin.
Eventually pancreas “burns” its insulin producing mechanism and can’t produce it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amount of the messenger is as important as cells sensitivity to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variability-in-receptor-structure&quot;&gt;Variability in receptor structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ligand - whatever the receptor binds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receptors consist of proteins, thus, are encoded using multiple genes. This creates variability. Cells can
change subunits of their receptors. This changes how well receptor does its job. E.g. an epilepsy can be
caused by cells reacting too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corticosteroids have cell type specific functions (due to having variability in subunits on the other end
of the receptor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variability-in-receptor-triggers&quot;&gt;Variability in receptor triggers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many receptors can bind more than one ligand.
E.g. Gaba binds Gaga. It is inhibitory.
It also binds the following 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;major tranquilizers (barbiturates) - that’s how anesthesia works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minor tranquilizers (Valium &amp;amp; Librium) - inhibits not that much&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;derivatives of progesterone - this has been used as anesthesia in 1950s. This may be related to mood shifts
over the course of reproductive cycle. Premenstrual syndrome = shortage of progesterone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modulation&quot;&gt;Modulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine two neurons A &amp;amp; B. A sends signal to B. When Gaba inhibits, it actually does not affect B (i.e.
how it reacts to the signal). Instead it affects terminals of A (i.e. its ability to impact B). Thus,
Gaba has effect only when A is triggered. Tranquilizers have the same modulation effect on Gaba. I.e.
they have any impact only when Gaba already has some effect (i.e. A is triggered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormones can do modulation too. E.g. CRH + Vasopressin can produce much more ACTH than just CRH alone, but
Vasopressin alone produces very little ACTH. Thus, Vasopressin just modulates effect of CRH and does not
trigger ACTH production on its own. Thus, it has effect only when CRH has effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Advanced Neurology and Endocrinology.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, I am actually looking forward to the next thought experiment and feel pretty excited
before starting to write (even though I haven’t read it yet). I think I got a habit now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How will you live in a brave new world?” from the tweet sounds very interesting.
It reminds me of Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Now I am actually pretty sure that they
two are connected. Look, all 3 words are the same. Hm… Let’s have a look inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-statement&quot;&gt;The statement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’ve arrived at Firearto, better known as ‘Earth 2.0’, an exo planet located over 200,000 light years away. As you walk down the exit corridor of your spaceship along with another million colonizers you think to yourself: What will I do here? Firearto is a planet that has no monetary system, all of your needs are provided for by FSY (Firearto Space Corp). How will you live your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment page is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/a-brave-new-world&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and it has links to other answers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-answer&quot;&gt;My answer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTH?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is like Universal Basic Income, but without money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a little bit more of explanation would be helpful. What confuses me is that it is hard to 
imagine such no money system. Is it like communism? Or I don’t have to work? Somehow from the text
it looks like no work is required. Can I have different needs from others? What if I want more than others?
Tricky…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the more freedom and vagueness we have, the more unique and personal our response can be.
So let’s happily start reducing all this ambiguity. 
Many of us are united by the idea of Financial Independence, so I assume that the thought experiment
is at least somewhat about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;all of your needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is boring to assume that this literally means “any” need. First, I could just go to this magical entity and ask for anything,
so there is not much to write about here. Second, this is hard to imagine in practice (yeah, I may have peculiar needs).
Third, if anything is available so easily, life will probably be quite boring. No goals to reach, no targets to hit, no
competition. It is actually funny to understand that I do enjoy this part of life. Before writing that I would have struggled
with claiming so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we say “all of your &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; needs” are covered. So we have shelter, food, basic fun probably. Oh, it is very hard not
to regress to something-like-money system. I immediately think about people having different needs. Perhaps I want more
books and other people like movies more. Thus, there should be some balance, which gets reduced with each need satisfied.
And, abracadabra, we just implemented money. Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we assume that everyone gets the same and somehow magically there are ways to request additional stuff.
E.g. if I want to do wood carving, I can hypothetically get the materials and tools. As you noticed above I have
no clue how to preserve fairness in such a system, but this thought experiment is about me doing stuff and not
designing such a system. Thus, I just ignore this inconsistency. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, but doesn’t then the question just become “what would you do if you were fat FI on a different planet”?
Like I have access to resources (e.g. requesting wood carving tools), it is not that limited (i.e. not a lean FI),
but I am just on a different planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we back to square one. What does this planet have to offer? If it is all just metal rooms without anything,
then it is quite tricky to live there. If it is exactly like Earth, then the answer is completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for a moment that I could read comments in the Twitter, perhaps someone tried to clarify, but there are none
and it would be a spoiler. I could also ask SavingNinja in a private message, but I feel lazy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, time to enable “thinking - no, writing - yes” mode and just go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No money raises an interesting question of motivation. Currently many people (including me) do a lot of stuff and
spend great portions of their lives being driven by money. This is not per-se bad. This new planet completely removes
this incentive (somewhat similarly to FIRE, but there it is only partially removed, since more money = smaller chances to run
out of money). For someone who is very work driven, such change can be dramatic. Many people experience this on Earth
when going into their retirement. So-called empty desk syndrome. I don’t think I am affected much. My money pursuits are motivated by
FIRE and I am trying to build my FIRE life still while working. I.e. I want to have enough activities, so that 
when I get more free time once I am FIRE, these activities just naturally fill the free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am tempted to say that I would try to live on that planet the same way as I plan to leave on Earth during FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, not yet, I could probably elaborate a bit more on the details. But this will just boil down to how to be happy.
I am now super curious what others will write and how they will understand the question. Looking forward to reading that.
It will likely be something very different from mine and I will be like “oh, how I could have missed this way to
understand the statement, it is indeed so easy and makes sense”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There still can be competition, it just won’t be motivated by money much, but instead by self-improvement and being
better than others. In some sense that’s what sport is meant to be doing. So there will be a lot of sport (often
non-physical) on that planet. Not sure whether I will participate much in the actual sport, but I will definitely 
find some hobby in which I will try to get as best as I can and which I enjoy. Becoming the best is usually not 
enough - there is always someone who is better than you, because they have spent plenty of time on it and
are probably naturally inclined to excel in that activity (aka talent). I am a fan of growth mindset, but still people
vary and e.g. one’s height matters in basketball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that I will try to form a lot of relationships. Probably with people interested in the same hobby and
just people whose company I enjoy in general. At least on Earth this seems to affect my happiness greatly. So I assume
that there it will be the same. Having basic needs satisfied by a magic entity is quite good for forming romantic relationships.
Often ways of satisfying needs (or having different needs) can become a source of conflict. E.g. if one person likes
one kind of food and other likes something different, it may be tricky for them to live together.
To be honest I struggle to come up with a good example of such kinds of food. But if you take the food out of equation,
they just eat what this entity provides, then they can enjoy other qualities of each other. E.g. they could be a perfect
match in all other categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I will also continue learning. Probably try to do some research. Even though this magic entity providing all the
basic needs seems to be quite powerful, I don’t think that humanity will ever solve all the research. It would be pretty
weird to at some point say: “Oh, we have researched everything, we are done”. Somehow it feels like there is no
end and one will always be able to improve something or discover something new. Obviously no proof here, just random
speculations. Some deep research always feels like a connection to nature for me. In many areas you solve problems
which other people created. These feel somewhat artificial. In research you may be touching problems in some sense
created by nature. This can then be perceived as you are a part of humanity, i.e. one entity competing with nature.
This looks intrinsically beautiful. It is not some artificial problem created by someone else, it is something
deep and intrinsic instead. Thus, if you take away money, this intrinsic beauty should become so much more important.
This can be a powerful source for finding meaning in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit scary to get lazy and start fulfilling all my needs without a limit. E.g. one can crave fatty or sugary foods.
Does it mean that one should eat them? Probably not. If all needs can be met, it is much easier to give up to such desires
and just start fulfilling them. Also postponing something for tomorrow might be a problem. Why doing something today if you can
do it later? I think the answer is “no reason, if you don’t want to, i.e. there is no intrinsic motivation”. The first issue
is not that prominent in FIRE due to limited resources and in some sense I am exposed to this now. I could eat plenty of 
sweet and fatty stuff already now, but I don’t. For the latter, it is hard to say. For intrinsically motivated stuff,
I will do it just because I want to do it now. For other, I probably just won’t do it at all then. I assume that there won’t
be any stuff which one has to do, since their needs are met. This also illustrated FI well. While not FI one has to work
because one needs to satisfy their basic needs. After FI, one just needs to take care of themselves (still satisfying basic
needs but on a different level), apart from that they are free to do whatever. E.g. they can lay in bed for days just because
they feel so. Probably a stupid example, but I like it, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is definitely interesting to see this connection between life on this magic planet and FIRE. I am now even curious
whether SavingNinja intended it this way. “Let’s ask them what they will be doing during their FIRE in a very implicit way”.
A bit “disappointed” that this has nothing to do with Huxley’s book. But the book was quite sad and dark, so I am happy
that this experiment is not like that. Funny enough I discussed satisfying too many needs too much above, which was also
in that book. In some sense even today people satisfy too many of their needs too well. Some shortage is beneficial (especially 
voluntarily, since then you can stop it at any moment and it is not dangerous). You don’t get to enjoy the sun without having rain
or winter. If you live by the sea you just get used to it and don’t care much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting how thinking about this magical planet brings ideas about issues in FIRE. That’s an interesting thought
experiment and it does precisely what thought experiments are intended to do - uncover stuff by thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I thought for a moment how one could increase the difficulty of this thought experiment directly to insane level.
Just assume that you are immortal on that planet. Oh, it is even scary for me to think about this, but I am not saying
that being immortal is bad. In the worst case one can voluntarily die I assume (unless in jail, oh, it is probably a very
tough punishment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, happy finding, building / reaching and then living in your own brave new world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I will now associate “brave new world” and this romanticism around the term with FIRE.
A bit dangerous since FIRE does not solve all your problems automatically, but still looks interesting.

I suspect that many people talk about this topic without having any clue
(“oh, this is must be due to hormones”). Thus, I am very excited to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;function-of-hormones&quot;&gt;Function of hormones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything started with single cell organisms. When multicell organisms appeared, the issue arised - how to
communicate across cells? There are 4 main mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cell-to-cell contact - physically touching, thus, short range. Like passing a note to a neighbor in a class.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paracrine (secreting paracrine factors) - local. Like whispering to several neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neuronal - fast. Like texting your friend during class.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Endocrine (hormones traveling through blood) - long range, but slow. Like sending email to entire class. Enables coordination across cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination is useful for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple coordinated cell transformations (e.g. metamorphosis)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To respond to environment (e.g. stress or sexual stimuli).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types&quot;&gt;Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Hydrophobic (lypophilic)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Onset&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Slow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Affect&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Existing protein activity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Transcription (rate of new protein synthesis)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can travel through cell membrane&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Examples&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;insulin, vasopressin, oxytocin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;glucocorticoids&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormones have subtle chemical differences in structure, but the higher level structure is similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hormone-release&quot;&gt;Hormone release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many endocrine glands in our body. Each secretes certain signal. Some are located in the brain. Often
peripheral glands are regulated by brain glands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signal flows from brain to hypothalamus, then pituitary gland and finally rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pituitary-gland&quot;&gt;Pituitary gland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consists of two parts - anterior and posterior. They secret different set of hormones and use different mechanisms.
To secrete hormones in anterior part, hypothalamus has to release its hormones. For posterior part hormones come
directly from neurons (i.e. there is a direct neural connection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anterior releases e.g ACTH, posterior - vasopressin, oxytocin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Feedback loops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of hormones can be controlled through feedback loops, e.g. cortisol negative feedback loop.
Cortisol gets secreted through CRH and ACTH. Each of glands producing these have receptors for cortisol.
When they detect cortisol in blood stream, they start producing less of CRH and as a result ACTH, thus, lowering
cortisol production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;effect-on-brain&quot;&gt;Effect on brain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To affect brain hormones have to travel through blood stream (i.e. cross blood brain barrier). 
This barrier is located in blood vessels. It regulates what gets inside/outside brain’s bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steroid hormones can simply pass this barrier. Peptide can’t on their own, but have a carrier transport for this.
Alcohol also passes blood brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a hormone to have an effect in brain, neurons have to have its receptors.
Different parts of the brain can be more or less receptive. Some areas just have more receptors.
There can also be individual variation in number of receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level of hormones can affect number of receptors. E.g. if there is too much of some hormone, cells
can decrease number of its receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Lecture 12, Endocrinology.

Lecture 11, Neuroscience - part 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time you heard about neuroscience, now something in your head has changed and you remember that you
heard about neuroscience before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;memory&quot;&gt;Memory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;super-memory&quot;&gt;Super memory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Wiltshire - an autistic savant. He can draw a very precise city view only after looking from an airplane
for some time. Savants take spacial tours through their memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanism&quot;&gt;Mechanism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory (learning) happens (to the best of our knowledge) in synapses. People used to assume that each new
memory leads to a new neuron. That is learning was perceived as equal to growing new neurons. Then people 
discovered synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory is synaptic plasticity. When your presynaptic neuron fires a lot in a given time, eventually this will
cause a stronger response in the post synaptic neuron. I.e. a simplified version of Hebbian Plasticity -
neurons that fire together - wire together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitating neurotransmitter is glutamate. It is excitatory and information is transmitted in the brain through 
activation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-term-potentiation&quot;&gt;Long term potentiation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long term potentiation (LTP) - getting more output for the same input. This can be achieved through e.g.
releasing more glutamate, reacting stronger in each of receptors, having more receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a way for post-synaptic neuron to communicate back - retrograde neurotransmitter, e.g. nitric oxide gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocampus is the site of memory and LTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is adult neurogenesis and adult plasticity. In the last 20 years it was discovered that adult brain
forms new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HM - person with their hippocampi surgically removed. As a result he could no longer form any new memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But LTP happens all over the brain e.g. for motor and emotion memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LTP can also go wrong, e.g. post traumatic stress disorder, when context brings undesired memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ltp-disruption&quot;&gt;LTP disruption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also mechanics for intentional disrupting LTP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hypoglemic states (i.e. when one is really hungry) lead to insulin cascades, which in turn reduces LTP.
In other words, if you starve, it is not a good time to remember something, but to find food instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stress hormones - improve short term memory (e.g. one may be able to remember tinniest details after
a car crash as if in slow motion). However, if the impact is chronic, this damages LTP and memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alcohol directly disrupts LTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;networks--inhibition&quot;&gt;Networks &amp;amp; inhibition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you connect each neuron to e.g. 10k others and overall you have 100B of them, small changes in each
synapse start having large effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be random and spontaneous generation of signal.
It is important for the brain to filter out the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to consider neurons as groups instead. They also have capability to inhibit. A neuron can
inhibit itself. This allows temporal sharpening. A neuron can inhibit its neighbors:
“this is my signal, ignore my neighbors”. This creates spatial sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be fast sharp pain and dull aching throbbing pain. There are two types of neurons and each type
is responsible for each kind of pain. Fast pain generates slow pain. Slow pain can inhibit first spike
of fast pain. If you get stung by a scorpion, the fast pain forces you to pay immediate attention, perhaps
the scorpion is still there. But there is no sense to keep this forever. Instead slow pain comes to remind you
that you still have the issue and have to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also allows retinal cells to be responsible for specific types of receptive fields.
Each neuron in your eye just gets a certain angle of light. This allows e.g. edge and contrast detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you activate a neuron in your retina, you get spatiotopic (oriented and aligned in a similar way)
field in the back of your visual cortex.
This was detected by tracing back which neurons a given retina neuron was connected to. Then this has been 
repeated for the next level. However, no single neuron activation was propagated. Instead a group of neurons
forming a line lighted up a neuron in the next layer. This was e.g. a neuron responsive to a vertical line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can construct visual world in layers by extracting features. The further you get, the higher order
abstractions you create (e.g. orange, banana). However, no one has found orange neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can simplify your brain to a neural network. Once a neuron is activated, it doesn’t know where the input came
from. I.e. it is a one-of function. So you can have concepts and categories. E.g. you have separate neurons
for impressionist painters. Then all of them are connected to one neuron. This one neuron can represent
impressionism. This is also how you remember stuff. You first remember a category and then try to narrow it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotionally salient memories last longer.
Context (like emotion) can get represented neurally too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory is encoded in such a neural network, not a single neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;variation&quot;&gt;Variation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory variation can come from variation in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how much glutamate gets released&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how strongly post-synaptic receptors respond&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ways in which neural networks are constructed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result there is spectrum from HW to Stephen Wiltshire.
We are in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;autonomic-nervous-system&quot;&gt;Autonomic Nervous System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It controls anything that happens automatically.
E.g. heart beating, digesting, goosebumps, orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nervous system can be divided into Central and Peripheral.
Peripheral divides into Somatic and Autonomic.
Somatic system is responsible for transferring sensory information from periphery to Central Nervous System
(CNS) and voluntary control (e.g. moving muscles). It is fast and myelinated (covered with 
myelin which allows faster signal propagation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomic - moves organs, unmyelinated and, thus, slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parts&quot;&gt;Parts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomic system is further divided into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sympathetic&quot;&gt;Sympathetic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible for arousal, alertness, emergency, flight or fight.
Releases norepinephrine (NE) into target organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;parasympathetic&quot;&gt;Parasympathetic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible for growth, repair, calm vegetative function.
Releases acetylcholine (ACh) into target organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interaction&quot;&gt;Interaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sympathetic and Parasympathetic have opposing functions.
Homeostasis - dynamic balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one exception - in male reproductive system they work together. Erection is controlled by 
Parasympathetic (and that’s why one needs to be stress free). Then Sympathetic overtakes and culminates
in ejaculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of erectile dysfunction - 60% of cases are due to stress and not organic basis in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premature ejaculation - transition from Parasympathetic to Sympathetic happens too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effects&quot;&gt;Effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Parasympathetic system is active, immune system works. In Sympathetic - contrary.
As a result, it is easier to get sick when you are stressed out (Sympathetic gets activated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE &amp;amp; ACh can inhibit and excite depending on the organ. E.g. in case of heart, there is excitatory NE reception
and, thus, it is excited by NE. Gastrointestinal tract has inhibitory NE receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regulation&quot;&gt;Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center of regulation of Autonomic Nervous System is hypothalamus.
Even reptiles have it.
Then there is limbic system, which is responsible for emotions in mammals.
As a result, seeing someone you hate can cause sympathetic response through limbic system (emotion) and then
hypothalamus.
In primates, cortex is responsible for thoughts and memories. As a result, just a thought can cause
a sympathetic response (from cortex to limbic system and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you think about a test, this activates your cortex, then limbic system, then hypothalamus
(so-called triune system of the brain). This cases sympathetic response. It can be similar to a reptile’s body
response to losing blood, but caused only by your thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomic Nervous System is highly plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biofeedback can be used to cure high blood pressure. You think of something pleasant. This decreases blood 
pressure. You repeat. Get further decrease. This makes the connection between this cortical thought and 
parasympathetic activation even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Slowly but steadily… Lecture 11, Neuroscience - part 2.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Human Behavioral Biology” - course summary (lecture 10) - Neuroscience</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-10-neuroscience" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Human Behavioral Biology&quot; - course summary (lecture 10) - Neuroscience" /><published>2019-12-03T08:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-12-03T08:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lecture_10_neuroscience</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-10-neuroscience">&lt;p&gt;Lecture 10, Neuroscience - part 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;broader-context&quot;&gt;Broader context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course tries to show how various sciences answer “why chicken crossed the road”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evolution - how behavior evolved, why it is adaptive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;molecular genetics - genes controlling the evolution, how they change over time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;behavioral genetics - what individual genes are responsible for variation in behavior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ethology - studying behavior in nature, stimulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we consider neuroscience - what happens in brain before the behavior and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chief function of the body is to carry the brain around. (attributed in Internet to Thomas A. Edison)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nervous-system--brain&quot;&gt;Nervous system &amp;amp; brain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nervous system is divided into central and peripheral. Central consists of brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stem - responsible for communication with spinal cord&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cerebellum - motor movements (especially when learning new stuff and correcting mistakes).
There is a peculiar experiment with prism glasses (everything appears normal, but in reality shifted
to the side). When wearing such glasses, one struggles with touching a target, because their brain
calculates object position as if there were no glasses. After some time (~minutes) one gets used to the glasses
and learns to touch the object as precisely as without glasses before. I.e. their brain learned 
how to correct for the shift. Once one takes off the glasses, they have the same “problem” again, but in the
other direction, and it takes time to autocorrect back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cortex
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;frontal lobe - plans actions, controls movements, each body part has its own part here and they
are located the same way as in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;parietal lobe - sensory touch info. Area per body part can differ, e.g. fingertips are overrepresented.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;temporal lobe - auditory info + memory formation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;occipital lobe - visual info (back of the brain)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limbic system
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hippocampus - forming new memories.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;amygdala - fear and anxiety - sweat of scared people (experiment described in a previous lecture)
lights up amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hypothalamus &amp;amp; pituitary gland - hormone secretion&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joke about 4 F’s of brain - flight, fight, feeding and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord has specialized areas too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peripheral system - all motor and sensory nerves + nerves for heartbeat, digestion, breathing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brain-cells&quot;&gt;Brain cells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santiago Ramón y Cajal is considered by some a grandfather of the modern neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before people thought of a brain as a web. He stained individual cells in the brain with black
and drew pictures of them. This way he investigated brain structure on cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;90% of cells in brain are glia (means glue).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;astrocytes supply nutrients to neurons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;myelin wraps around neuron wires and makes the signal go faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;microglia - immune system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neurons - computational units (100B in average, each has 10k synapses-connections).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;neuron&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consists of dendrites (inputs), nucleus (cell core), soma (cell body), axon hillock (start of output),
axon (output) and terminal (end of output branch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuron is binary (on or off) instead of gradual (i.e. there is no middle level of activation). This helps to keep
resting potential. Sending of information happens through movement of ions (charged chemicals).
Neuron keeps itself quiet by keeping positive ions outside of the cell by using pumps.
Net charge inside is as a result negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dendrites receive neurotransmitter, channels for positive ions are opened. This changes the charge.
If there is a lot of positive charge, neuron may fire further. If there is enough, channels on axon
hillock open to let more positive ions in, this creates a positive feedback loop.
Positive ions in the terminal trigger sending the signal further to the next neuron.
As it was said above, this is also binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop, cell opens other channels to let some positive ions out.
Axon terminal stores large amounts of neurotransmitter packaged in vesicles (discrete structures).
After that a channel can be opened in the next neuron to let ions in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter might induce transcription factor.
Neurotransmitters are located in terminals.
Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dopamine - commonly associated with reward, pleasure, but it has many other functions too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;epinephrine (adrenalin) - involved in flight or fight response&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;norepinephrine - pretty much interchangeable with epinephrine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;serotonin - e.g. regulation of sleep, appetite and mood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gaba - inhibitory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;glutamate - excitatory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to remove used neurotransmitter from receptor (re-uptake), otherwise it will keep signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;neuropharmacology&quot;&gt;Neuropharmacology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External manipulation of synaptic events, e.g. for research or to correct a disease state.
Often this involves something resembling a neurotransmitter, but not fully. Hallucinogens often
work like that (e.g. LSD resembles serotonin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can weaken synaptic response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with Parkinson’s have low level of dopamine in brain areas responsible for movement. One can increase level of dopamine globally, but this will cause other issues (e.g. schizophrenia-like symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hm&quot;&gt;HM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient HM - a man who had terrible seizures. As a fix, his hippocampus was removed. As a result, he 
couldn’t form any new memories. He could remember some stuff from childhood.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Lecture 10, Neuroscience - part 1.</summary></entry></feed>
