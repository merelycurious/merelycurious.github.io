&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-up-to-previous-lecture&quot;&gt;Follow-up to previous lecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;heritability&quot;&gt;Heritability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that humans have 5 fingers is an inherited trait.
However, the variability of #fingers is exclusively due to environment, thus, heritability
is 0%. People often assume that heritability tells whether a trait is inherited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;previous-disciplines&quot;&gt;Previous disciplines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous three approaches (behavioral evolution, molecular genetics, behavioral genetics)
are just descriptions at different levels. For example one can view epigenetics as either of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the way how culture and environment affects biology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the way in which environment turns genes on/off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regulation of chromatin, remodeling, regulation of genes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;behavioral-genetics&quot;&gt;Behavioral genetics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;classical - adoption studies, good at showing that environment has less impact than assumed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;modern - we suspect that a given gene has some behavioral effect, let’s see which.
Alternatively, we suspect that this behavior is genetic - let’s see the link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observed-effect-size&quot;&gt;Observed effect size&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When evaluating studies, keep the observed difference size in mind.
For example, there was a study of 250k 18 years old in Norway, which has shown that 
first borns have higher IQ than second borns. There could be multiple ways to explain this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parental investment - no, they controlled for this, if you are the only child, you have
lower IQ than first born with younger siblings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Tutoring” phenomenon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mother age (egg quality) - they controlled for this too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each pregnancy causes immune suppression, a mother could become less healthy after the first pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to age 12 second borns have higher IQ than first borns. By age 18 it gets other way around.
A second born IQ reverts to the level of first born, if the first born dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the difference was only 2.3 IQ points (as Sapolsky says “sneeze at the IQ test
and you get this difference”), i.e. not important at all (even though the study has been done
in a very elaborate fashion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-8-recognizing-relatives&quot;&gt;Lecture 8: Recognizing relatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability to recognize relatives can be present even in very primitive organisms. E.g. deer mice have 2 strains -
monogamous and polygamous, the later has sperm competition. When sperm forms a clump,
it travels better. However, in polygamous strain sperm tries to form a clump only with its own kind. 
In the monogamous strain, this is not the case (happily forming a clump with any sperm).
In the polygamous case, sperm “knows” who it is related. This is example of single cells recognizing
relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can show innate relative recognition by cross fostering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanisms&quot;&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pheromones&quot;&gt;Pheromones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pheromonal communication can be used for relative recognition. 
One needs qualitative differences e.g. in urine (reflecting genetic makeup)
and some mechanism to process the differences. This is achieved by creating a completely
unique protein (major histocompatibility complex), which functions like a fingerprint.
This protein is attached to each of your cells (at the surface). Your immune system
uses it to detect your own cells. This protein can become soluble
(saliva, urine) and give unique signature to pheromones coming off of you.
These protein structure is also more similar in closer relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin and vasoprasin tune cells in olfactory system for better accuracy to recognize relatives and,
if the match is good, take care of them (e.g. baby after birth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only 2 areas in the brain, which have neurogenesis (new neurons generation) in adults  - hippocampus (learning) and behind olfactory bulb.
In rats, new neurons in the olfactory bulb are created before giving birth. This way the mother can detect her babies better and
bond to them. This can explain weird sense of smell during pregnancy as well as a desire for unusual
foods. Basically, olfactory system gets heavily renovated to improve accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baboons distinguish social implications of dominance reversal depending on family relatedness
(if rank 4 submits to rank 27 - others have no interest if 4 and 27 are from the same family - “crazy relatives”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mating, one has contradicting goals - prevent inbreeding, but to pass as much of their own genes as possible.
As a result, mating with the 3rd cousin (i.e. two of your grandparents are siblings, i.e. had the same parents) is the optimal solution.
This is observed in nature. Humans also find the odor of 3rd cousin the most appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-innate-recognition&quot;&gt;Non innate recognition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non innate recognition requires imprinting, i.e. learning who’s mother / baby.
The fact that learning occurs is innate. One can learn sounds, odor or appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goats don’t have innate ability to recognize relatives. Instead there are other approximations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“smells like my vaginal fluids”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lick the kid and “smells like my saliva”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scent mark and “smells like me”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mouth smells like my milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be used to detect siblings as well, e.g. “smells like my mom vaginal fluid”.
This can be proven by cross fostering, the goat will take longer to decide (“hm, it does not smell
that much like my vaginal fluid”), but in the end will take care of the kid anyway (“but there is no other baby,
so yeah, it must be mine”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cognitive&quot;&gt;Cognitive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans do it cognitively. Hey, I see this one baby around me, it must be the one I just gave birth too.
Who was the father? The only guy with whom I had sex. To detect sibling - “I saw mom giving birth to them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baboons can also do this. Males care about kids more when they are sure.
E.g. “if I am the only one who mated with her” (for example, female can be too young and
not that fertile, thus, no interest from higher rank baboons and, as a result, mate with exactly one lower rank baboon).
They also consider probabilities - the closer to female’s prime fertility point a baboon mated with her,
the more likely he is to take care of the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works even in fish. In sunfish males are very paternal. If you bring another male
(e.g. in an transparent container) between a female and a male (closer to the female), the latter male will assume
that he is not the father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusiform cortex is used to recognize faces.
Normally it fires more for relatives (e.g. mom &amp;gt; stranger &amp;gt; chair).
In autistic people it does not work well (mom ~ stranger ~ chair).
Sheep and pigeons have it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies can distinguish mom smell after birth (but not dad’s) - when given two sources of smell,
they prefer one with mom’s smell. The can recognize mom’s voice (by learning it from inside),
but not dad’s (hard to hear it from inside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this affect your decision who to mate with?
One study considered Kibbutz in Israel, a collective community, which raises their kids all together.
If two kids were raised in the same age group up to 6 years of age, they never marry each other.
In other words, if it is someone, who you spend a lot of time before 6 years of age, you don’t mate with them
(they are more like a sibling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways to manipulate us to feel more/less related than we are (pseudo kinship / pseudo speciation).
Military does this a lot (us - brothers, them - non-humans).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Lecture 8, recognizing relatives.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The luckiest investor or what if you knew the future?</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/luckiest-investor-or-investing-when-knowing-the-future" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The luckiest investor or what if you knew the future?" /><published>2019-05-19T07:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-05-19T07:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/luckiest_investor_or_investing_when_knowing_the_future</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/luckiest-investor-or-investing-when-knowing-the-future">&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you have 1000 USD on the evening of 31st of December, 2017. In addition to that
you happen to know daily prices of all US stocks in 2018. How much money could
you make by taking into account the future and investing perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this does not have that much practical sense, since we don’t know the future.
However, I was curious how “knowing the future” outperforms passive investing.
In other words this could be in some sense an upper for investment returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is complex, so let’s make a bunch of assumptions to simplify the problem a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On a given day, only one of the following actions is allowed:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Buy one position with all your cash at the lowest price available during that day.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sell everything at the highest price available that day.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transactions are free.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One can buy only securities, which are available at 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#getting-started&quot;&gt;IEX&lt;/a&gt; (I had to get the data somewhere).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All transactions succeed no matter what (e.g. volumes are ignored).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One can buy fractional shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may look like holding at most one position at a time is limiting. However, the optimal
trading sequence is like that. Imagine that you bought more than one stock. Then you sold them
and got some profit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;imagine you got the same profit from both. Then you could have bought only
one of them originally and the overall sequence profit would have stayed exactly the same.
In other words, if the first sequence (with more than one stock at a time) is optimal, then
the resulting sequence with at most one stock at a time is also optimal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;otherwise, one of them brings more profit. Thus, if you buy only this better stock (instead of two stocks),
you will only improve overall sequence profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a simplistic proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the results. This way if you are not interested in all the details,
you don’t have to waste your time going through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you get 2235976324368894910070981708437303314132384811588503138465677325225209962386423808 USD.
Yeap, for people confused, this is 2.2e+81 USD. 
&amp;lt;here goes a default boring comparison with number of atoms in the universe&amp;gt;.
This is equivalent to 63.93% return on investment, &lt;strong&gt;daily&lt;/strong&gt;. 
A lot, right? Penny stocks happened to be very volatile, you know.
And in order to achieve this, you just needed to do 
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/post_resources/luckiest_investor/sequence_with_penny_stocks.html&quot;&gt;these 107 transactions&lt;/a&gt;.
Easy-peasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, now this feels boring and less exciting than I expected it to be.
Moreover, I feel like buying stocks for 2.2e+81 USD can be tricky these days.
What if we forbid penny stocks? In particular, let’s not buy anything cheaper than 5 USD per share.
Boom, 1537713047211124526310105417510931136512 USD (i.e. 1.5e+39, daily ROI 25.64%,
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/post_resources/luckiest_investor/sequence_without_penny_stocks.html&quot;&gt;transactions&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argh, this is still just some unrealistically large number. And I don’t recognize literally any of these stocks.
Ok, let’s get &lt;em&gt;really conservative&lt;/em&gt; here and restrict ourselves to S&amp;amp;P 500 only. 
Buying penny stocks can be tricky to execute, trading volumes can be low, volatility may be too &lt;em&gt;volatile&lt;/em&gt;.
So S&amp;amp;P 500, it is. And… &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;30 853 548 412.13 USD&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. 3.1e+10, i.e. just almost 31 billions, ROI 3.1e+09%, daily 4.84%).
So what did you have to do? Just 
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/post_resources/luckiest_investor/sequence_s_p_500.html&quot;&gt;these dozen of dozens transactions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so this is now much more interesting (at least for me). The number is somewhat realistic
and the first transaction involves AMD, which I know. I declare this a success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious, my code is available in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/merelycurious/luckiest-investor-data-analysis&quot;&gt;this Github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-research&quot;&gt;Further research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am curious to look more into “S&amp;amp;P 500 only” transactions, e.g.
how long each company was in the portfolio, how large their relative impact
on the final result was and so on. However, this post already took 7 hours
and I haven’t even started writing the methodology yet. Moreover,
I decided that I will have breakfast only after finishing this post
and it is 12:03 already and I am starving now. And I have super tasty curry in the fridge,
which I cooked yesterday. Obviously, it was not my original plan to eat curry for breakfast,
but it is also not strictly a breakfast anymore. So I hope you understand me (and curry)
and I may write another post about this some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure you all would love to know how I got the numbers above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dataset&quot;&gt;Dataset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I needed to get daily prices from somewhere, 
so I took them from iextrading.com (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/&quot;&gt;API docs&lt;/a&gt;).
These folks don’t even require registration (i.e. you don’t need an API key),
which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For S&amp;amp;P 500 I just used &lt;a href=&quot;https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies#data&quot;&gt;some random datahub.io csv dataset&lt;/a&gt;,
which was built from Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimization&quot;&gt;Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have the numbers, how do we find the optimal sequence of transactions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key observation here is that if we have X shares of a given stock Y on day
Z, then we don’t care at all how we arrived in this state. E.g. we could have bought
them yesterday or 1 week ago, but this has zero effect on the final outcome 
(i.e. amount of money we have in the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to apply so-called dynamic programming. Basically for each day of
2018 and each available stock 
we want to calculate the maximum amount of that stock we could have had.
I.e. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[2018-03-14][APPL]&lt;/code&gt; is a maximal number of APPL stock
we could have had on Pi day in 2018 (i.e. by doing optimal transactions before).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the problem definition, we know that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[2017-12-31][$]&lt;/code&gt; is 1000
and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[2017-12-31][&amp;lt;any stock&amp;gt;]&lt;/code&gt; is 0 (we have 1000 USD and no stocks
at the beginning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can notice that we can calculate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[&amp;lt;date&amp;gt; + 1]&lt;/code&gt; if we know
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;]&lt;/code&gt;. If we are in a some state on some date, there are only
3 actions we can perform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hold what we have&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if we have cash, buy something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if we have something, sell and get cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we can just go over all states, try to perform the action and see whether
this improves the result for the new state. For example, buying stock X means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;best_quantity[&amp;lt;date&amp;gt; + 1][&amp;lt;stock X&amp;gt;] = 
	max(best_quantity[&amp;lt;date&amp;gt; + 1][&amp;lt;stock X&amp;gt;],
	    best_quantity[&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;][$] / &amp;lt;price of X on &amp;lt;date + 1&amp;gt;&amp;gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, imagine that you have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;][$]&lt;/code&gt; USD on the day &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (evening)
and you want to buy &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stock X&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You can do this by waiting until tomorrow, i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;date + 1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
and just buying that stock according to the current price. Why do we have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;max&lt;/code&gt;?
Because there may be other better ways to get more of this stock (e.g. by buying it earlier
at a cheaper price and just holding).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this for each date and each symbol, we get our final answer in 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[2018-12-31][$]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to get the actual optimal sequence of transactions? Each time some &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity&lt;/code&gt; is improved,
we can just save which action has led to this improvement (i.e. from which state
we got there). Using this information, we can easily see how we got to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best_quantity[2018-12-31][$]&lt;/code&gt; and 
go to the previous state. And then just repeat this process of going backwards, until we reach our initial state
of having 1000 USD. Once we know 2 adjacent states, reverse engineering which action it was is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this wasn’t as smooth as I expected (and I have to explain spending at least 7 hours on this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;noisy-data&quot;&gt;Noisy data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly the issue was with weird prices in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my first attempts returned something like 10^124 USD, which was
somewhat larger than I expected. After inspecting the proposed sequence of stocks,
I discovered some very lucrative transactions, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2018-05-30 buy ZAZZT 7.87048936311242e+47 @ 0.9  
2018-05-31 sell ZAZZT 8.185301067147553e+52 @ 103999.9  ROI = 115554.44444444444
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in the data it was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ['2018-05-29', None, None, None, 0.9],
 ['2018-05-30', None, None, None, 0.9],
 ['2018-05-31', 87359.95, 103999.9, 103999.9, 87359.95],
 ['2018-06-01', None, None, None, 87359.95],
 ['2018-06-04', None, None, None, 87359.95],
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which looked very fishy, so I just dropped all price points where at least one value was missing
(i.e. 35098 price points out of 1962200, i.e. 1.7% - yeah, I was worried to drop too much, so I checked
the percentage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brought the result down to $10^115. This time the transactions were less awkward, but still odd.
Example culprit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2018-02-12 buy ZWZZT 2.5002156249822376e+16 @ 12.5  
2018-02-14 sell ZWZZT 1.600121998608632e+21 @ 63999.36  ROI = 5118.9488
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ['2018-02-09', None, None, None, 18.1],
 ['2018-02-12', 12.5, 12.5, 12.5, 12.5],
 ['2018-02-13', None, None, None, 12.5],
 ['2018-02-14', 5, 63999.36, 63999.36, 5],
 ['2018-02-15', None, None, None, 5],
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like an outlier.
Thus, let’s kick out price points with all 4 values being the same
(65112 out of 1927102) and with max-min ratio larger than 10 (20 points out of 
remaining 1861990).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets us down to $10^84.
The only suspiciously large ROI now was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2018-10-04 buy ZXZZT 5.209604829132704e+61 @ 10.86  
2018-10-10 sell ZXZZT 6.338984640830725e+66 @ 121678.8  ROI = 11203.309392265193
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting this one was not obvious, so I started looking at trading volumes as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; ['2018-10-03', 100, None, None, None, 10],
 ['2018-10-04', 1200, 10.86, 11, 11, 10.86],
 ['2018-10-05', 100, None, None, None, 10.86],
 ['2018-10-08', 835, 0.0072, 0.0072, 0.0072, 0.0072],
 ['2018-10-09', 800, 168998.31, 168998.31, 168998.31, 168998.31],
 ['2018-10-10', 400, 121678.79, 121678.8, 121678.79, 121678.8],
 ['2018-10-11', 100, None, None, None, 121678.8],
 ['2018-10-12', 300, 115198.85, 127998.72, 127998.72, 115198.85],
 ['2018-10-15', 400, 99999.9, 100000, 100000, 99999.9],
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity I just removed all price points with less than 1000 trading volume
(51610 out of remaining 1861970).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave 2.235976324368895e+81, which you have already seen above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;penny-stocks&quot;&gt;Penny stocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After morally accepting that number, I noticed that majority of the transactions are just penny stocks anyway, 
which is not that interesting (they are volatile as crazy). So I just stopped “buying” anything cheaper than $5 per share.
I know that not all of these are penny stocks, but this affects only 226071 price points
(and I am hungry, remember the curry), so the limit is $5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brought us down to 1.5377130472111245e+39 USD, which still didn’t feel completely satisfying.
So that’s how I started limiting stocks to S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am going to finally eat my curry (“Hooray!” says my stomach).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="investing" /><category term="stocks" /><category term="coding" /><category term="mini-project" /><summary type="html">Imagine that you have 1000 USD on the evening of 31st of December, 2017.

Lecture 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-7-behavioral-genetics-ii&quot;&gt;Lecture 7: Behavioral Genetics II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genetic-packages-metro-dogs-example&quot;&gt;Genetic packages (metro dogs example)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example similar to the domesticated Siberian foxes case is metro dogs in Russia.
They are effectively selected for avoiding humans, being in packs and aggressive temperament.
As a result, they start looking like wolves very fast (e.g. tail shape). This appearance is not needed
for their survival, but it comes as one genetic package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behavioral-genetics-approaches&quot;&gt;Behavioral genetics approaches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern version of behavioral genetics tries to find a gene for something. 
In the classic version, a phenotype was considered and then individual genes
were compared in individuals, which have different phenotype trait (e.g. eye color),
i.e. something external. Alternatively one can look at proteins and how they function (i.e. an intermediate step between
genes and traits). Finally one can investigate differences of protein sizes (without knowing
the precise function). However, this works only in “simpler” cases, like looking for a gene
for a specific disease like PKU, cystic fibrosis (but not TV taste). Now find a family where
approximately half has the disease. Find a segment of DNA which everyone with the disease 
has, but no one without. This usually gives you a stretch of DNA consisting of 10-30 genes.
Somewhere in this sequence there is “the gene”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One must be very certain in the conclusions before claiming anything
(e.g. ways to detect diseases can be used to decide whether to abort pregnancies).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bio ethics - there is a very low statistical chance that you’ve got a wrong marker.
Should people get tested for the disease using these markers anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding “the gene” - most diseases are not caused by one gene. There are ways to find multiple genes,
e.g. gene microarrays (which involves forcing a cell to produce all RNA it has and then gluing it on a chip,
keyword: QTL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starting-with-gene&quot;&gt;Starting with gene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to start from a gene and to study it across species.
E.g. you have 2 different versions of a gene and try to see differences in behavior,
protein function or size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue - this way you look only where “the light is shining”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vasopressin hormone - in rodents (vole) its receptor defines
whether an individual is monogamous or polygamous. The difference is in promoter.
After discovering this, one can ask whether this holds for people and try to see the differences.
It does actually hold - if you have the monogamous promoter - more stable relationships. How good one at reading faces also
depends on this. Families with autism have mutations in vasopressin receptor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BNDF protein - prompts growing new neurons. In rats causes creation of new connections in amygdala
and impacts anxiety levels. There are different versions of it. You can study this in rats and then in people (this has been done). In humans the type of this protein identifies likelihood of anxiety disorder and level of stress hormones in blood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dopamine (DF4 in rodents) - defines levels of risk-taking behavior in humans (novelty seeking).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NPY - differences of levels of anxiety in humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all of these explain only a small portion of overall variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;role-of-random-events-chance&quot;&gt;Role of random events (chance)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brownian motion - intrinsic movements of molecules (completely random).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria has their own DNA and there can be different mitochondria DNA in one cell (mitochondria divides on its own). When a cell splits, the resulting set of mitochondria DNA in each daughter is random (based on 
position of mitochondria in the cell during the split).
The same is true for transcription factors and splicing enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is not “Nature + Nurture”, but “Nature + Nurture + Chance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heritability&quot;&gt;Heritability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All such studies result in some statement like “this trait has 53% heritability”.
The meaning of this is often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heritability does not tell how genes affect average value of a given trait,
but instead the degree of variability around the average.
E.g. imagine a trait with values 9, 10, 11 and another trait with values 1, 10, 19.
In both cases the average is 10, but the variability is larger in the second case.
In this example heritability does not tell how much genes determine the average value 10,
but variability instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example - imagine a plant with 3 versions of a gene (A, B and C) defining how well it retains water.
There is a difference of this trait across A, B and C (i.e. this gene has good predictive power).
At the same time environment affects it much more, thus, heritability is actually low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/7_environment_vs_genes.png&quot; alt=&quot;A histogram showing environment affecting the trait value much more than the gene&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to study only one environment, it will look like genes are much more important than they actually are.
Unfortunately, that’s how science mostly works (take one species like some dessert rat and study it, i.e.
control for environment). This removes ability to see the role of environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random peculiar fact - how to measure protein size - put them somewhere where they move as a
function of their size and measure difference in position (e.g. sinking in a gel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you had to predict trait level - would you choose environment or genes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans inhabit a lot of environments. There are gene-environment interactions, which can change gene effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying only one environment inflates heritability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heritability of number of fingers in humans. Genes define “5”, but not variability. The variability is 
e.g. due to industrial incidents. Thus, 0% heritability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Men with earing in 1950 were rare, but almost all women had earrings. The variability is caused by gender,
thus, 100% heritability (if you had to guess, you would love to know individual’s gender).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;environment-is-important&quot;&gt;Environment is important&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples where environment plays crucial role in the outcome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PKU is related to a disorder, when toxic phenylaline cannot be turned into a safer thing inside the body. 
To predict the disease, would you like to know where the person lives or whether there is a mutation
in the enzyme? Obviously, mutation, 100% heritability. But the disease highly depends on food.
One can avoid certain foods and don’t be affected by the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider another gene, which is related to depression.
  There are 2 versions - “good” and “bad”, which affect how prone to depression one is.
  However, this also depends on number of major childhood stressors they had 
  (divorce, loss of parent). What do these genes do? It depends on your environment.
  If you have no stressors, then the “bad” version actually makes you less prone to depressions
  (the study observed tiny differences).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/human_behavioral_biology_summary/7_depression_gene.png&quot; alt=&quot;A plot showing the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; gene being better without any stressors, but much worse with stressors.&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The number of stressors actually defines level of stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gene, which affects predisposition to aggression. The graph is the same as above, but the horizontal
axis is “child abuse”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FAD2 - predicts IQ abilities and is involved in carbohydrates metabolism.
The environment in this case is “breast feeding”.
I.e. it predicts IQ abilities, if you have a diet high in carbohydrates very early in life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On average men are better at math than women. 
However, is this genetic? When studied all over the world, 
the greater the gender inequality was, the larger was the difference in math scores.
It is not a function of gender, but the society type. In Iceland (smallest gender inequality)
girls are even slightly better at math than boys. If we wanted to guess, we would rather 
known whether they are from Tunisia or Iceland. Even when considering top 1%, this is still
not much about genes (in the US in 1950 the ratio was 13 boys to 1 girl, nowadays - 3 to 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more environments you study, the lower heritability is going to be. We are giving more opportunities to
say “it depends”. As a result, it is meaningless to ask “what does this gene do?”, instead it should be
“what does this gene do in this particular environment?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single genes define a lot for flies. Even when you see a gene for X,
is it just an indirect effect (like height causing being an extrovert)?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Slowly (but steadily) going through the Sapolsky’s course.

However, occasionally it is much more important how you invest your time.
I call this  (surprise) “time allocation”. Let’s see how to do this and a couple
of unexpected examples, where percentage looks much scarier than the plain number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trigger&quot;&gt;Trigger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking into this topic to estimate how much “free” time I normally
have per week. The idea was to make sure that, when I plan something for a given week, I don’t set
obviously unreasonable goals. At first this wasn’t anything special,
I just used some quick spreadsheet and got the numbers. However, then I checked
the percentages (i.e. how many percent of my weekly time a given activity takes)
and was surprised by how much I underestimated them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beauty&quot;&gt;Beauty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of looking at your time allocation has many interesting properties.
For example, if you do some activity every week (let’s imagine for the rest of your life),
then this weekly time allocation becomes “rest of your life” time allocation.
This definitely makes you feel differently. This implicitly forces you to prioritize:
“Wait, this will take 10% of my life, do I actually need to do this?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another observation is that time is your main resource.
Yes, you can use money for some approximation, but money is just 
a representation of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I know how you spend your money and your asset allocation, I do know
a lot about you. But knowing how you spend your time, gives away almost everything about you,
except your reasons for doing something, i.e. “why”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a common advice to look at what people do and not what they say.
This exercise partially helps you to look at what you do, instead of what you 
feel you do or want to do. People are bad at estimates and it is very easy to say
I am X (e.g. writer) and feel like you spend enough time on this activity.
What if you discover that only 5% of your weekly time goes to X?
Are you then just 5% of a writer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also be peculiar to know at the end of a life how much time went 
into something. This could be some kind of ultimate measure, how much of a writer
a person was. Obviously, different activities consume time differently, so it may be
that you are indeed a writer, this just didn’t require that much time.
I agree. I don’t claim that this “answers your life question” or that it is completely perfect.
No, but it gives an interesting perspective, which I enjoy and find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it may be tricky to get a complete picture, since majority
of things we do are not repeated across weeks. I suggest you to start with at least
something and just consider activities you do weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely plan to explore better time tracking (probably at a very low granularity
for a short period of time). I do track my expenses, so optimizing time is an obvious next target.
Having this data would help me to get a better picture of my actual time allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to&quot;&gt;How to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you are now intrigued enough to give it a try.
I prepared 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qa4PZYtSACpZm2HEDDgZvoeXUAIYOmeBvLWaJYeERyQ/edit&quot;&gt;a spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;,
which you can reuse (just make a copy).
5 minutes granularity was reasonable for me, so that’s what
the spreadsheet has, however, you are welcome to use 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically each cell means “how I spend the next 5 minutes”.
Below there are cells with all the calculations (sums and ratios).
The data is just an example to give you an idea what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how various activity durations correspond to percentages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 hour daily -&amp;gt; 1 hour / day * 7 days / (168 hours / week) = 4.1% week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 hour every working day -&amp;gt; 1 hour / day * 5 days / (168 hours / week) = 2.9% week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 hour once a week -&amp;gt; 1 hour / (168 hours / week) = 0.59% week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 minute daily -&amp;gt; 1 minute / day * / (60 minutes / hour * 168 hours / week) = 0.069% week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone asking your for a commitment taking 1 hour once a week
for the rest of your life? If you agree, you will “spend” 0.59% of the
rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-improvements&quot;&gt;Possible improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously everyone has to sleep and do exercises and this is good.
However, when these are taken into account in the denominator, we are
implicitly incentivized to spend less time on them. This feels wrong.
Thus, you may subtract some activities from denominator (i.e. from 168 hours per week, sleep is
an obvious candidate) to mitigate this issue. For my use case,
this was not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s see what caused this, what the risks are and how I now avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trigger&quot;&gt;Trigger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that I have somewhat burned myself out recently. This is definitely not the complete
burn out and I am getting much better now, but this made me revisit my lifestyle
and priorities. Overall, my wellbeing definitely suffered: I had pessimistic mood, which
changed often, and too much interest in food (aka overeating, mostly of sweet and fatty foods).
Previously I definitely had periods where I felt somewhat down, but I never experienced such
overeating before, which obviously scared me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hypothesis&quot;&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to find out what’s wrong and… googled it. I could have gone to the doctor,
but I prefer to spend couple minutes (ok, this is a lie, couple hours, whatever) researching
on my own to save the trip if the issue
is not too bad. There happens to be a lot food related psychological disorders and
some of them are very bizarre. I probably won’t go into many details here, since it is not
the most pleasant thing to read about. But one bit caught my eye - basically some website claimed
that one can overeat to compensate deficiency of fun in life. Eating sugary and fatty foods
is similar from chemical perspective in brain to consuming drugs and having fun and if you have too little fun
your body just tries to fix this by binging and overeating (as the last available resort to have some fun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-causes&quot;&gt;Possible causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that aiming for FIRE can promote such state.
It may sound weird, but doing something fun actually requires some effort
(at least you have to do something not-so-fun before it becomes fun, like going somewhere or
preparing something). So if one uses their energy efficiently (aka just being lazy), they are
in some sense disincentivized to do something fun due to the effort involved.
Normally, the positive side of the activity is so strong that people don’t even notice
the effort involved at all or it is masked by anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, FIRE adds another reason against doing something - money.
You’ve already cut out a bunch of unimportant stuff from your life and pretty much got 
used to this way of thinking - do I really need this? What I am actually paying for here with my money (i.e. time)?
So when considering doing something fun, now we have at least 2 reasons against it.
First, it requires some effort. Second, money. It is also peculiar that this “money saving
perspective” affects one’s default choice. Normally people would rather do 
some fun activity by default if they are not sure. But after cutting out so much garbage,
a person aiming for FIRE will rather have “not go” by default. Moreover, sometimes answering 
“do I actually like or need this at all and which exactly part of it and why?” is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if one does side hustling to reach FIRE faster, this can produce another
heavy argument against doing something fun. In particular, one can think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will rather reach FIRE sooner by side hustling now. Then I will have all
the fun in the world. Ok, back to side hustling now instead of this “fun” activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already the third brick against the fun activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is very easy to focus on FIRE and delay (or even ignore) everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risks&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One risk is your body disagreeing. This is just my personal anecdote, but I suspect that
this is a very likely outcome. A peculiar consequence of this (a wild speculation) is the risk
to change your overall view to FIRE. Imagine that you work hard, focus on FIRE and ignore everything 
else. Your dissatisfaction may grow and get collected inside you. At some point you can just snap
and overcompensate all the way out of FIRE completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting option is that this may affect your post FIRE life negatively.
Imagine that you’ve been finding reasons why a bunch of fun activities (like going to a
theater, but insert something else if your opinion of fun is different, I understand)
are not that interesting to you.
And then on one magical day you conclude that you are now FIRE and have plenty of time
to actually do all the fun… Oh, wait, is there anything fun left? You’ve been finding
reasons against going to the theater for years, will reaching FIRE magically switch
something in your brain and you will forget all these reasons? I doubt that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this boundary between having fun and spending too much is very faint and narrow.
So you probably might overshoot a bit. To avoid that I would suggest to see by how much having fun
does delay your FIRE date. If it is something like 1-2 month, this is comparable to
error margin (e.g. due to the market mood swings) and seems pretty safe. I understand that you
can be very rational and having your fun budget invested will improve your FIRE chances
and date, but if you then overstretch yourself, forget rationality and drop FIRE idea completely?
So 1-2 months seems fine, everything else is up to you. This is your life and your money
and you probably shouldn’t trust Internet when deciding what to do with them (but I use 1-2 month
approach, just FYI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://merelycurious.me/pages/calculator.html&quot;&gt;a calculator&lt;/a&gt; precisely for that
 (disclaimer: this is the very early version, so early that I can’t even call it first). Basically it allows
you to answer question “if I decrease my investing by X once/every month/year, how much does this delay my FIRE date?”
and X is meant to be your fun budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally started to catch myself whenever I have some positive feeling towards doing something fun.
Instead of shooing it away with “I am busy, perhaps come back later?”, I stop and remind myself that
I haven’t been doing anything fun for ages and my wellbeing has taken a hit and occasionally it is
tricky to understand what I really enjoy, so I should probably do this activity. I definitely keep in
mind the money aspect (e.g. I still have fun efficiently, for example, by choosing the cheapest theater ticket).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope to stop delaying various ideas and projects. I understand that they may not speed up
my FIRE process, but I would rather build my small scale version of FIRE life now and then upscale it
once reaching FIRE instead of being completely demotivated and having no clue what to do with all
the free time I’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

to start doing tasks where you are scared to fail or to avoid dangerous activities. Let’s see
how it helps me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like feeling embarrassed, failing or showing my incompetence. 
I’d bet many of you are the same. However, these fears are pretty irrational
and they can prevent me from doing or even trying to do something where I can
fail. I especially observe this in creative work and large complex tasks.
In creative work there is always something sitting inside you and
whispering (or shouting) “this is shit, no one will like it, people will laugh at you,
don’t waste your time, you know this, just give up and call it a day, do something easy
instead, even you don’t like it” and so on. In the case of large tasks, there are so
many different parts to it that you just can’t have a complete plan. As a result you
are not sure whether what you are doing now actually helps you to accomplish the task. In both
cases this is like an internal built-in heuristic against wasting your time. There are
situations where this makes sense, but nowadays this is rarely the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking “what is the worst that can happen” helps me to get through this heuristic.
In most creative efforts (like writing this blog post or coding a game) the failure is not
as bad as it is perceived to be. For example, I am writing this blog post now
and I am not sure whether it will end up being interesting or useful to anyone. 
But what is the worst that can happen? Someone won’t like this post and may write
me an angry email. Or I won’t like this post myself and just delete it completely without
publishing at all. Asking this question helps me to change my perspective. Instead of 
being scared of this abstract notion of a failure (the last word should be read with a spooky voice),
I actually try to make it explicit - yes, I can fail, but what does that mean precisely? Is it actually
that bad and scary as I think? More formally you just explicitly estimate a lower bound for the outcome.
Instead of saying abstract “failing is bad, I don’t like failing” you say how bad it actually is.
This gives you something precise to cope with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/the_worst_that_can_happen/before_after.png&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration showing one large spooky vague failure somewhere far away on the negative
side before asking the question and a bunch of specific failures with definite locations
on the negativity spectrum after.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One negative consequence present in any endeavor is wasting your time.
You did something, it didn’t work out and is of no use now, the time spent doing it is gone
(if I add “forever” here this feels even scarier). However, that’s fine. First, you tried
to experiment with something, to do something risky and unusual and you didn’t manage.
This is much better than just giving up and perhaps you have learned something in the process
which may improve your chances next time. Second, even if you don’t “waste” your time on this task,
how would you use it differently? At least for me this often means consuming some content
(like Reddit or Youtube). But time spent doing this is gone forever too and I am not sure what
is better, since I will very likely learn nothing from Reddit or Youtube in majority of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formulating a task in a specific way can help as well. One can say “I will do this large cool
game perfectly and publish it immediately and show to millions of people” and this becomes hard.
Just finishing a game is already tricky, doing this perfectly on the first try is impossible.
Furthermore, the commitment to publish it just increases the amount of embarrassment you can get.
Instead you can say “I will create the first version of my game somehow (it won’t be perfect but
will show the concept) and I will show it to 1 person”. This person can even be you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is a good example of me applying “what the worst that can happen” iteratively.
I am definitely not sure whether a given post will be interesting to anyone except me,
but in the worst case it will be just there and people won’t read it (or I delete it instead of 
publishing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach can also be used to avoid dangerous and risky stuff. If you ask yourself
“what the worst that can happen” and if the answer does look scary to you (e.g. physical injury
for the rest of your life), you probably shouldn’t do this. However, this approach is not perfect 
and you can’t just follow it blindly. This is just a lower bound of the outcome, which does not
take into account how likely the outcome is. Reasoning with this approach one shouldn’t fly on planes,
drive cars or even get on the street all, because the worst outcome there is death.
Thus, once you feel that the lower bound is too pessimistic, you may consider some more likely outcome instead.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I find them very useful
in this new context. E.g. they can be a hint to prioritize and to postpone less important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-todo&quot;&gt;What is a TODO?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TODO is just a comment in the code describing a way to improve a given bit of code
(basically what should or could be done later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be various reasons to add a TODO, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the thing it describes is blocked on some other work (e.g. refactoring)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;currently the author does not have time for this much better approach described in a TODO,
while the current approach is good enough for now, but could be improved later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO accomplishes number of functions, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping the author not to forget to do something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;informing the reader that
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a given bit can be improved&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the author knew about this better way, but for some reason decided not to do it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todos-outside-of-code&quot;&gt;TODOs outside of code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I started using TODOs in my code, I naturally started adding them in other areas of my life as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you do a large enough project (e.g. writing a large blog post or trying to plan
a large event), you have a lot of tasks and can feel overwhelmed. Often there are just
to many of them and some can even pull more further work. As a result, if one is a perfectionist, one can
easily get stuck already at the first task by going too deep into it and producing very little utility
for the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, imagine you are doing some website to test a new idea.
You could setup its backend perfectly, including, for example, plenty of tests, easy one click scalability
and super powerful servers. However, very soon in the process this stops helping much with your original goal -
to test an idea. Perhaps the idea won’t work for some other reasons and all this hard work will be then even wasted.
On the other hand, it can be hard to just say “ok, I will do poor quality work here” and
setup the backend in a poor fashion (especially when one is a perfectionist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here come TODOs (or you could call this “prioritization”, but TODOs sound more exciting). One can accept
that the backend setup could be improved, evaluate the relative benefits and if in doubt just leave a TODO
to do this a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; later (if later ever comes). Basically, instead of saying “I did shitty job here”, one says
“yeap, this is not my best masterpiece, but, hey, I know how to improve it and if it ever becomes a problem,
I will do that”. If later does indeed come, one can reread the list of TODOs and reprioritize them based
on the new state of the world (new knowledge, demand). If later does not come, one has just saved plenty of
time not by doing that TODO. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a funny fact, I have a comment with a TODO right above this line to add a link to a post about
importance of time. The post does not exist yet, but once it does I can search for all TODOs
and replace this one with a link.&lt;/p&gt;

but the file was there. This took me some time to figure out and I would like to 
share the issue (a non-obvious stray whitespace in the filename) as well as other ways this could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief-intro&quot;&gt;Brief intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may not know what Jekyll or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_url&lt;/code&gt; is.
Let me briefly explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for creating static html blogs.
Basically you give Jekyll your blog “source code” and Jekyll “compiles” it 
into nicely looking static html blog, which you can then host somewhere (like GitHub pages).
As an example, this blog is done precisely like that - Jekyll + GitHub pages.
Can’t I write plain html myself without any fancy “compiling”? I can, but that’s cumbersome.
I would have to explicitly care about html when writing my posts and also manually add all the 
boilerplate to each page. Instead I just write a text of the post (i.e. the most exciting part of the process) using
special language called markdown and Jekyll does all the remaining boring stuff for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post_url-tag&quot;&gt;post_url tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This markdown language has special commands, which one can use to make writing easier.
This can be something simple like making text &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; or something more
complex like creating a table or adding a link somewhere. These commands are called tags.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_url&lt;/code&gt; is a tag for adding a link to another post in your blog.
Obviously, I could just hardcode a direct link, but &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_url&lt;/code&gt; has couple advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;complains if the link is broken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes the link if something changes (e.g. domain name or post url change)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allows not to think about what the link will actually be and, thus, saves times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happily writing 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lectures-4-5&quot;&gt;a summary for lectures 4-5 of Robert Sapolsky’s course&lt;/a&gt; 
and I wanted to add a link to 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lectures-1-3&quot;&gt;the summary of lectures 1-3&lt;/a&gt;.
So I wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1-3 - Intro &amp;amp; Behavioral Evolution]({% post_url 2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3  %})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the file I just copied. To my sheer surprise this didn’t work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Liquid Exception: Could not find post 
&quot;2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3&quot;
in tag 'post_url'. Make sure the post exists and the name is correct. 
in /blog/source/_posts/2019-03-26-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_4_5.markdown
             ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT:

                    Could not find post &quot;2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3&quot;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After googling for some time, I accidentally noticed that
the filename of the post I was trying to link to had a space right before the extension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                                    this little guy here
                                                                        \
2019-03-17-human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lectures_1_3 .markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I copied the filename, the space was copied as well, but Jekyll ignored it, because that’s
how tags work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that Jekyll tags handle spaces inside the file name well, e.g. a file named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2019-03-17-human behavioral biology sapolsky course summary lectures_1_3.markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;works perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-possible-causes&quot;&gt;Other possible causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I spent time googling this, let’s collect here other possible causes, which could lead to this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post is not published. This can happen for multiple reasons, e.g.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;explicit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published: false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;published date is from the future (including due to timezone)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;wrong folder (it should be in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the file is missing the date prefix or it is not separated from the rest of the filename with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The post belongs to a collection (use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#link&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt; instead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this does not solve your problem (or you are curious), you might look
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/post_url.rb&quot;&gt;at the source code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(based on their responses to SavingNinja thought experiment #5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-losing-everything&quot;&gt;my response to the previous thought experiment&lt;/a&gt;
I thought
that it would be cool to write an overview of all the responses. Perhaps
there are some patterns and peculiarities. This is my first attempt at this.
Obviously I have no clue where this will go, but I will just start reading
all the responses and then see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please find it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDRC1HheipxzNJWfaS-xhy2aj7NPqLD5ndsu_gRmGMg/preview&quot;&gt;this Google Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions--peculiarities-discovered&quot;&gt;Conclusions / peculiarities discovered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were 2 ways to understand the problem statement. One is to describe
what you will do once you reach FIRE somewhen in future (i.e. after your normal
FIRE date). Another is to assume that you magically reach FIRE today (at least
3 responses did this).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I forgot about some stuff when was writing my post, like reading and languages.
However, this probably just illustrates that these are less important for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One can use this overview to find like minded people,
e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://asimplelifewithsam.com/&quot;&gt;Sam @ A Simple Life&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thefireshrink.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The FIRE Shrink&lt;/a&gt; would both
like to do more gardening once reaching FIRE.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surprisingly, at least 4 responses do include part time work
and only one (&lt;a href=&quot;https://financeyourfire.com/2019/04/15/thought-experiment-fire-now-what/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;Marc @ Finance Your Fire&lt;/a&gt;) says 100% no to work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For some reason, learning French is very popular (at least 3 responses).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only one post was from an already retired author (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youngfiguy.com/retiring-from-retiring/&quot;&gt;Young FI Guy&lt;/a&gt;), I did enjoy their perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure why you would like to read them, but below all the notes I took
while reading the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people want FI? They want time (like during their childhood).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always wanted to be a game developer, but went to mobile development for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream: having a title on Steam (or Project Stadia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a novel (an epic fantasy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating my own mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building (shed, sawmill, barn, stables, home)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not fired yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describes one project to be done in the nearest future
(next step for personal finance and budgeting software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get an impression that the author assumed that “they have reached FI today,
what would they do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describes their experiences during Brexit vote day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to the gym multiple times a week (plus possibly some sword fighting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to bed whenever feeling like it, the same for waking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning. French and Spanish. Joining a choir, relearning the piano.
Doing a masters degree in Shakespeare.
Doing this already, but giving more time and attention after FI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteering (conservation works in the countryside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow travel. Spending weeks rather than days, being able to speak the language and culture immersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying 1€ house in Italy. Training at Muay Thai camp in Thailand. Going to India or Bali to become a qualified yoga teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decompressing and understanding real priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears. Absence of motivation to stay fit, family rejection, busy friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumption: hitting FI today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably continuing working part time as a transition before the trip to Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Swahili and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sport: training better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending more time with family (e.g. niece) and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength training 3 or 4 times a week instead of 2 now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing learning to do handstand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food - interesting restaurants and trying different cuisines from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing DIY projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the trip, probably quiting work.
Doing another trip, but to South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a family (having a kid).
Full time parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More slow travel.
Spending more time with their partner.
Improve at sports.
Watch sporting events and music.
Play music.
Volunteer.
Building a house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream of not being tied to the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of usual “stuff” they could do
(spending time with their wife and kids, traveling, reading, writing, learning to play piano, carpentry, photography, build our forever home, gym, hiking, learning French)
but there is no point to go into this.
Let’s rather consider a project, for which he will have more time and energy once FI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describes his childhood visit back to the country of origin 9 years after leaving for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is to return to the native country, but not for a holiday.
Understand history and culture. Know their relatives better.
Enable children to understand roots and mother-tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charity work in their birth country - helping children to get out of poverty.
Probably introducing financial literacy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their wife is worried, that they will be too busy during FIRE.
Family is the highest priority, especially after FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://merelycurious.me/post/thought-experiment-projects-when-fire&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No precise projects, since plenty of time before FIRE to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming, data analysis, making websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing projects differently - sprinting (focusing on one project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects are defined very broadly (a finite chunk of work with a title).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derailing into how to collect ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing more in the blog, including posts requiring more time.
Art (juggling with humor, learning to draw, playing music and composing).
DIY - sewing. 
Cooking - more unusual and time consuming dishes, including for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggests to upscale current lifestyle in FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably stand up comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sport (everyday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubt whether answered Saving Ninja question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioning MMM advice to see what you are doing on weekends these days
and to expand it to the full week once FI. MMM suggests to think in terms of
the following categories: outdoors, social, physical, generous and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time for garden. Growing vegetables all year round.
Selling some produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being much more active member of existing social groups in the village.
Posting more on Twitter and other social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking more. Cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More direct charity helping work (once a week or once a fortnight).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning French and Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving advice to the readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying art and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel, trying new things, have friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIY,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t ask me exactly what I want to do – I haven’t a clue!
But it will be fun whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially: visiting coffee shops, practicing doing nothing, reading books, travel,
contemplating, donating time (volunteering), smiling to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could one get Olympic depression syndrome after FI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pledging not to return to earning money after FI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not going to work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making music (electronic, DJ skills).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing and painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a book (a novel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t underestimate boredom.
Without it you can’t have its counterpart states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc is not scared of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling more with his brother
(but not for the traveling sake, rather to relax, enjoy life, do nothing).&lt;/p&gt;

Which projects would you?
This is the new shiny thought experiment by SavingNinja. And I have a lot to do, indeed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to my response, let me introduce the concept, so that you understand all the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/category/thought-experiments/&quot;&gt;“Thought experiments”&lt;/a&gt;
is a project by SavingNinja. The idea is that some hypothetical situation is posted every 2 months
and participants must write down their thoughts without any preparation or major editing.
This should uncover their inner views and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took part last time and the topic was “If You Lost Everything” (&lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-losing-everything&quot;&gt;my response&lt;/a&gt;).
Without doubt it was much darker, but nevertheless interesting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projects-after-fire-thought-experiment&quot;&gt;“Projects after FIRE” thought experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment’s page is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesavingninja.com/what-will-i-do-when-i-retire&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
(it also contains links to other bloggers’ posts)
and the “problem” statement is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life is good. You finally did it! You pulled the plug on your day job after reaching financial independence. 
You never have to work for money ever again. But, you’re bored. You need something to do… You need a project! 
You grab a piece of paper and a pen and start thinking. Now that you’re financially free,
what projects do you want to complete? However ambitious, however small,
you now have the time to pursue anything that you like, what will you accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPD Apr 20, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;: FYI, I’ve prepared an &lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-overview-projects-when-fire&quot;&gt;the overview of other participant responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-reply&quot;&gt;My reply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-reading-the-new-experiment&quot;&gt;Before reading the new experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I am doing the writing in the morning to avoid any scary dreams during the night
(I didn’t have any last time, but just in case).
Let’s see what Savings Ninja prepared for us.
In his tweet he wrote that not everyone will be able to “partake” in this one, so I am curious why.
My guesses are that this could be related to gender (but this would be weird) or perhaps FIRE status
(e.g. a question to already FIRE’d people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after-reading-the-new-experiment&quot;&gt;After reading the new experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, this one seems pretty easy.
Basically what I want to do (focusing more on projects side) once I “retire”.
Obviously, I can’t tell precise projects, because I may accomplish some of them before FIRE,
however, I can definitely try to explain the general theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I have plenty of random ideas for projects already today.
These are mostly related to programming, data analysis and making websites.
I would definitely spend more time on these. However, currently almost all of them tend to have some 
money making part and this could go away once I FIRE. I can’t say that I explicitly filter my projects
to make money (I don’t drop ideas, which are unlikely to make money), but I get majority of ideas
like that anyway. So it is probably something inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would probably try doing my projects differently once I FIRE. Currently there is always not enough time
and I can spend only small portion of my time on my projects. As a result they all take multiple weeks.
I would definitely try doing sprinting more (e.g. one week or even entire month for one project full time).
Not sure whether this would work perfectly, because I may then get bored, I like to have many ongoing things at once
and jump back and forth between projects, which interest me the most. However, trying won’t hurt me and having a reasonably
finished project in a reasonable time might feel pleasant too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably should explain more what I mean by projects. As I said, there is not much point
to talk about specific ideas, since I will probably address majority of items on my list
before FIRE. However, by projects I don’t mean something large. It can be pretty small.
I also don’t have any specific limitations for my projects. If it looks like a finite chunk of work
not related to other things I am doing and for which I can define an actionable target
and a title, this is already a project in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually have multiple lists in my life, because ideas (sometimes even good) come randomly,
so I try to make it as easy as possible to record them and whenever there is any urgent need,
I don’t have to come up with ideas, but just check my list. In some sense, I precache my ideas
for some topics to save time later when there is a need for that topic. I should write a post
about this (I can call it “Catching ideas”). Here are couple of ideas for the post, so that I
don’t forget: I suspect that the rate with which ideas appear is constant (assuming that you 
don’t have major lifestyle changes). Thus, one should optimize how easy it is to record them
and time for how long one collects them. It is similar to having a net and just catching some
fruits falling from a tree. It is important to write even “bad” ideas, the first impression may be wrong,
deleting an idea later is easy, you may learn something new later, which will change your perspective.
For me ideas usually come as a reaction to something I saw or read. Occasionally this can be a
combination of multiple sources. You actually saw above how I got an idea for the new post. 
Now I have added this to my internal list of ideas for blog posts. As you might have noticed I have
&lt;a href=&quot;/queue/&quot;&gt;a public list of ideas for blog posts&lt;/a&gt; 
as well. Actually I think I have too many blog post ideas and not
enough free time for all of them. As a result, I publish some of them just as ideas (I should definitely publish a new batch)
and then see which ones people visit the most. This helps me to prioritize. Having too many ideas 
(or in other words choosing which ones to pursue) is the next problem you have pretty quickly
once you develop a good idea “catching” approach. You could say that I could choose the ones I like the most,
the issue is that I like almost all of them :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I got derailed badly. Sorry, sorry. Regarding projects, even a larger blog post requiring 
some research is a project. It has an actionable goal - write a blog post about X - and a title e.g. “blogpost X”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t think I would be able to work full-time on my projects, because it is pretty demanding work.
I can’t be sure, but I suspect that I won’t. E.g. currently on weekends I rarely have 8 hours of 
clean “project” work. I definitely won’t force myself, because then I will just hate all my projects and that’s
not my goal. As a result, I would likely do something else in addition to projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense I may now derail into general “life after FIRE” instead of “projects after FIRE”, but the term “project”
is very broad for me, so it is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely write more in my blog. Probably even somewhat weirder blog posts, which currently I filter out
because it feels like I am the only one interested, but then I could give a try to a couple. I think I would do
more blog posts requiring more background work. Currently, when I have not that much free time, spending entire week
on one blog post feels wasteful. Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I would try to develop artistic part of me more. Currently, this feels like it is not worth it, because this is
mostly just for myself, but I definitely feel desire to try. One way would be to improve my juggling skills and then
start juggling for other people entertainment. I enjoy combination of juggling and humor very much and I think that
juggling provides a lot of opportunities (failing can be fun) and I would try to develop some small act of mine
involving juggling and trying to be funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also interested to learn how to draw. However, I am extremely bad at this right now and it feels like this will take
me eternity. So for now it is again not worth it, but when I have more free time I would try for sure. Another similar
area is music (playing music instruments and composing). Here I am probably even worse than with drawing. I would be
interested to moderately develop my skills. Perhaps I am just curious whether I just don’t have ability (which I don’t
believe, but this could be the first example) or just didn’t spend enough time practicing effectively. Currently both drawing
and music look like magic to me. Moving something from “magic” to normal life is a wonderful feeling, which I greatly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I could do more DIY, e.g. currently sewing interests me as another medium of expression. Making a couple clothing items
looks interesting. Probably now you understand the name of my blog. When I see my lists of things I could do I occasionally
get a feeling that I may be even too curious sometimes. I hope that this does not harm me, but prioritization is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, also cooking. I enjoy cooking. I feel like the result is often multiple times better than the effort involved.
I also like to cook kinds of food, which normally everyone just buys and few people think how to cook it from scratch.
Sometimes cooking such food is extremely
easy, so I end up cooking it every now and then even though everyone else just buys it. One example is bread. After
some practice, baking bread becomes extremely simple and fast (in terms of active time spent - not waiting). After FIRE
I would cook unusual and more time consuming dishes more often. Perhaps even I would cook for other people. 
Currently I often cook something quick, because again - time. I extremely rarely cook for other people these days, but this is
a very important part of cooking in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, ok, this is much longer text than I originally expected. It also didn’t go that easy at the beginning, but now
I completely missed how I wrote that much. I feel a bit weird, because Savings Ninja might have meant more
concrete project ideas here, but my concrete planning horizon is not that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also why would I actually wait until FIRE to do something? It becomes apparent from the text above that I will be doing either
more of or just more intensively stuff I am doing right now. I think that this is how it should be, because you should live a good
life now and not somewhen in future. So if I had some super interesting project, I don’t think I would ever say “oh, cool, let’s wait
until FIRE to do it”. Ok, in some sense I am doing this for my artsy ideas (e.g. juggling with humor), but I juggle these
days as well. So again I will be doing something similar, but in a more time consuming manner after FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way stand-up comedy interests me as well, but probably not as much as stuff above since I remembered about it only
now. But I can imagine giving it a try. I would also experiment more with my life and try new things for sure .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would do sport more often (like everyday). This is hard to call a project, but I would love to do more sport
and currently (again) have not much time for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To calm down my inner self, I can give you a couple of things I am working right now, which you can use as a basis to extrapolate
what I will be doing after FIRE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;larger projects:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I am making a FIRE game (it is in some sense a simulator of life with FIRE related bits). This is a very early stage, so
nothing to show yet. I will definitely make a post about it and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/merely_curious_&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I saw an interesting African music instrument in a museum (known as rain-stick) and now I would like to reproduce it at home. 
The original one used some plant parts, which I am going to replace with pistachio shells. Currently I am at “collecting
pistachio shells” stage. Since I don’t eat pistachio that often (even though I avoid expensive 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/crazy-pistachio&quot;&gt;“crazy pistachio”&lt;/a&gt;
I saw recently, they are still pricey enough to be enjoyed moderately), this takes time. This is also an example of a project, which is interesting, but does not have that much of a practical benefit. I should make a blog post about this as well.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/pages/calculator.html&quot;&gt;FIRE calculator&lt;/a&gt; which tells how saving or spending X euro affects your FIRE date
(i.e. how many days sooner or later it will be).
I made a rough prototype, but then I got busy with other projects and now this one waits for its golden time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for blog posts you can have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;/queue/&quot;&gt;my public post idea list&lt;/a&gt;.
Every view counts and affects what I will write about next, so
thank you a lot for your help! As I said, prioritization is hard and you help me enormously by somewhat implicitly expressing your interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and thank you a lot, Savings Ninja, for making me think and even write about all of these. Everyone should do this occasionally,
even people not interested in FIRE. FIRE definitely promotes such thinking and makes “what I want to do with my life” question
much more burning, since you can get more freedom to actually do something with your life. I am pretty sure that my views will
somewhat change by the time I reach FIRE, I don’t think that this will be a major change, but definitely polishing of some details.
I also claim that answering this question can be a game changer for FIRE. I don’t have practical
experience, but I suspect that if you go into FIRE without clear understand what you enjoy and want to do, the free time you will
have will be like a punishment for you. It will be just boring, because there won’t be anything really interesting to do.
So it is better to start thinking about this earlier or even building some version of the life you want already before FIRE 
and then just upscaling this life. I hope that my approach (having a lot of time shortage now and just satisfying this demand
in FIRE) will work. What is also funny, that I have never noticed before that I implicitly cut so many activities due to time shortage.
Without an overview in one place, I noticed that I stopped myself sometimes from doing something time-consuming,
but this felt like rather rare incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now extremely curious why not everyone may be able to partake in this experiment? Did Saving Ninja mean people who are not
trying to reach FIRE? But they probably won’t read his blog that much. Hm. Something is weird here. I should ask him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I forgot, after the last thought experiment, I thought that it would be cool to compare responses of other people (i.e. 
categorize them and make a table with an overview). This time I am going to do this. Unfortunately, I can’t do this now,
because there is nothing to read yet, so I will have to wait until people start publishing. So if you are curious
to get a general overview, come back in couple days (or perhaps a week to be sure), I will post a link here (and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/merely_curious_&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; as well).
This must be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
