I was surprised how
many stages this required. Overall this looked like a dark UI
pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is non-obvious how to actually cancel the membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main page looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/1_main_page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Main page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there is “Prime” section, let’s go there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/2_prime_page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prime page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some trial and error I landed at “Update your settings”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/3_update.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Update your settings&amp;quot; dialog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, “End Membership”, now we are talking. It is quite funny that this
entire flow tries to tell me that I will lose all the benefits of
“Prime” membership by canceling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is definitely not the end of the story (probably more
like a middle point). The next screen gets more pushy and tries to
hint me again that I will lose all my “benefits” if I cancel prime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;List of benefits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user is also presented with one bright blue button, which does not
lead to cancellation and two very similar yellow buttons - only one of them
is the correct one. Funny enough it is not the rightmost one. I think
most of the UI teaches the user to click rightmost one. Ok, I increase
my attention level to the maximum and click “I Do Not Want My
Benefits”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Extend your membership?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure the though process was like “oh, looks like this guy
is pretty serious, let’s use heavy artillery… and offer 7 days of
Prime for 0.99 EUR”. WTH? I can’t imagine any use of 7 days of Prime
for 0.99 EUR. Again we see nice blue button, which does not lead to
cancellation and now 3 yellow very similar ones. Only one of
them is the correct button and it is in the middle. At least I am still
able to click it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Really cancel?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another screen. Again two very similar buttons. The upper one is
the correct one. For some reason they changed from horizontal button
layout to vertical. I am pretty sure this just adds confusion and
leads to a few more people clicking the wrong button by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this was the last step (but I already braced myself for more):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cancellation message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very curious why they stop at 3 screens and not like 10? I find 3
screens already awkward. Perhaps this is just to “protect a poor user
from making a &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; choice” and 10 would be too scammy. Fortunately
they don’t require writing a poem in Chinese about why I want to
cancel and lose “all the wonderful benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;

than I expected. Thus, here is my guide, which does not involve any
payed apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you install strings, try to keep the right order of pegs. In
other words adjacent strings should be wired through adjacent pegs.
This will help you a lot during tuning and will prevent any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuning&quot;&gt;Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tune the lower string in each pair as if it is just a normal 6
string guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we start tuning upper strings in each pair starting from the
bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The two lowest are just the same as their paired string.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The remaining 4 should be one octave higher than the other
 string in the pair.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a tuner for 6 string guitar, tuning one octave higher may
be non-trivial. However, you can use a tuner, which shows hertz
measurements. I used an Android app
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta
ils?id=com.bork.dsp.datuna&quot;&gt;DaTuner&lt;/a&gt; for this (I am not associated with this
app in any way and find it quite confusing, but it shows Hz
measurements which was enough for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the final tuning in herz should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(bottom most string) E4 – 329.6 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E4 – 329.6 Hz (same as above)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B3 – 246.9 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B3 – 246.9 Hz (same as above)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G3 – 196 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G4 – 392 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D3 – 146.8 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D4 – 293.7 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A2 – 110 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A3 – 220 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E2 – 82.41 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E3 – 164.81 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ignore everything except the Hz numbers. Just make sure that
the app shows the given number for the given string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in the Internet suggest to tune the 6th string (i.e. G4) slowly
and letting it to “rest” in the process, since it is so high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the tension is high, so after tuning some strings, the later
strings will detune earlier ones a bit and you can to check them
again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a guitar more or less tuned, you don’t need to use Hz
measurements anymore, since majority of tuners know all the notes and
will show you the distance to the closest note even if it is not one
of 6 string guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy well tuned playing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I recently needed to tune a 12 string guitar and this was less trivial than I expected.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amygdala&quot;&gt;Amygdala&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was already mentioned before, when one has amygdala damage, they
look less into the eyes. In other words, amygdala also “looks” for
signals. Testosterone makes amygdala better at detecting fear and
anger in faces. There is shortcut for visual information to amygdala
(lateral geniculate). This is faster. E.g. cortex can still be
deciding whether it is a 2D or 3D object, but one has already stubbed
other person due to the shortcut (i.e. you trade speed with analytical
accuracy). This pathway is hyper excitable in individuals with post-
traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams syndrome - imprinted genetic disorder. Kids having this
disorder are facile with language and emotions, but cognitively
impaired (IQ approximately 70). They are extremely trustful and, as a
result, vulnerable. They can’t evoke amygdala activation through scary
faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social phobias - any face activates amygdala (i.e. any face is scary).
Under clinical depression, amygdala activates when one observes
something sad, in other words amygdala is contextual (sad is scary,
when you have a depression).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amygdala is also best at dichotomizing - us vs. them and responding to
out-group stimuli. This will be considered in more details later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;frontal-cortex&quot;&gt;Frontal cortex&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible for appropriate behavior. When there is a choice between
doing something easy or hard (but better), frontal cortex makes us to
do the harder thing. It does not apply strong influence, instead it
has many weak and diffused projections. In other words, it gives bias
via slowly “massaging” the signal. This works like modulation. In
other words frontal projections are very diffused and relatively weak,
so they bias towards excitation rather than cause it. Frontal cortex
also has inhibitory projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is “fuel” for this activity. It is not only about
anticipation, but also about driving the behavior needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex also handles gratification postponement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex neurons have high metabolic rates (i.e. work hard), but are also very fragile, which leads to many frontal cortex disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;california-verbal-learning-test&quot;&gt;California Verbal Learning Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a test for dementia - CVLT - California Verbal Learning Test.
A tester tells one: “Today I bought [list of 16 unrelated items]” and
then asks to repeat the items. However, items can be separate into 4
categories, e.g. 4 fruits, 4 hardware etc. The tester repeats the
sentence and one can remember more and more each time. However, one
also begins to group items into categories. E.g. they remember fruits
first and name them and so on. This is executive function - notice
patterns, try to keep track of categories. Frontal cortex handles
this. When there is frontal cortex damage, one remembers items as
usual, but never does the grouping. In other words, frontal cortex
does “I see a pattern, I suspect if I put effort to exploit it, this
will make me more productive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also another test. One sees a circle and then is given time
of the day like “11:10”. They are asked to draw the time as if the
circle is a clock. One draws hours at 11 and then minutes at number
10, because this is the easiest interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another test is to name months backwards. One starts with December,
then November, October, September and then switches to go forward
again, i.e. October, November. They can’t hold off overlearned, more
habitual response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When then they are asked to count from 20 to 1, they do 20, 19, 18,
17, September, October, i.e. slip into the previous task (it intrudes
the next one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-rules&quot;&gt;Learning rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine there is a monkey. They need to pull a lever after seeing a
visual light signal to get food. You see visual system activity
increase during each signal. Frontal cortex gets activated after the
first signal and stays activated - tries to learn the rule from
individual examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point some rule becomes automatic, i.e. it gets stored
somewhere else in the brain. E.g. a demented person may be not able to
tell names of their children, but be able to knit (since they learned
that as a kid). Cerebellum seems to play large role in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-behavior&quot;&gt;Social behavior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same applies to social behavior, e.g. Phineas Cage
[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;] - foreman at a
railroad construction in 1840s. There was an explosion and a metal rod
went through Cage’s head damaging frontal cortex. It was hot due to
explosion, so it cauterized the blood vessels. Cage was conscious
shortly after the impact. Before the event, he was sober, religious
and highly reliable. After - abusive, sexually predatory, out of
control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays one can study frontal cortex via older people with natural
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25% of men on death row had a history of concussive head trauma to the
front of the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is Mc Naughton rule in the US - if individual can’t tell
difference between right and wrong, they are considered organically
impaired (i.e. this is insanity defense rule). Not seeing a difference
between right and wrong implies e.g. not covering tracks after a
criminal act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. John Hinckley (severe schizophrenic) tried to assassinate Reagan
in 1981. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. However then
Mc Naughton rule got implicitly banned, since people were unhappy that
Hinckley was “getting away”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are people with frontal cortex damage, who can tell the
difference between right and wrong, but can’t control themselves. One
can suggest such a person 5 candies in one hand and 1 in other. When
the person chooses 5, they get the other hand, i.e. 1. They always
choose 5 and get 1. They can even explain you the rule and then choose
5 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chimps fail this test too, but they pass when you give them wooden
pieces to choose from (but reward with candies). I.e. they can control
themselves enough when it is about wood (they don’t care much about
it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For kids there is one classic developmental test with marshmallow. One
gets left in a room with a marshmallow. If they don’t eat it, they
will get 2 instead. This test predicts frontal cortex metabolism as
well as SAT scores many years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little kids have not developed frontal cortex. As a result, when you
play hide and seek with them and ask “where are you?”, they reply
because they can’t stop themselves. Also when they count, they do 7,8,
9, 14, 17 - they can’t inhibit. At age 5 there is a relation between
resting frontal cortex metabolism and socioeconomic status.
Glucocorticoids atrophy neurons here (they have the most receptors
here). I.e. stress of poverty affects size and activity of frontal
cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another example of a mass murdered, who had a massive car
accident when he was 6 years old, which destroyed his frontal cortex.
As a result, in 11 years he committed the first murder. The last crime
was kidnapping a women. After holding her for a week, he just casually
brought her home and left his phone number suggesting to meet again,
since he had a great time with her. He got arrested in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Acquired sociopathy” - one get’s only some part of rules, especially
when getting frontal cortex damage before 5-6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all frontal cortex damage makes a person murderer. They
just can be out of control. E.g. one can be playing piano at a social
gathering for too long, not listening to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 18th century epilepsy was considered a demonic possession. The
person was considered a witch and burned. The legal test was - if they
don’t cry due to a story of crucifixion, they must be a witch. Then
there was a person noting that glands can atrophy, i.e. a person can
be organically impaired and won’t be able to cry at all. Does the same
apply to frontal cortex damage? What should the court do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex is the last part of the brain to fully develop. On
average it matures around the age of 25. As a result, it is the least
constrained by genes (instead shaped by environment and experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In teenagers - dopamine variation is much stronger (i.e. when adult
has low dopamine, teenager has even lower and otherwise). As a result
there is no death penalty for crimes made between 16 and 18 years,
since the brain is not fully mature yet. However, it is not clear what
exactly happens to one’s brain on their 18th birthday, making death
penalty ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is third most vulnerable region to normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Substantia nigra - motor system (thus, tremor of old age
Parkinson’s)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hippocampus - memory problems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often people believe that older people accept how they are and listen
less to opinion of others because of that, but this is due to frontal
cortex damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resting-metabolism-variations&quot;&gt;Resting metabolism variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with elevated frontal cortex metabolism. Highly regimented,
disciplined, capable of controlling their behavior. Do not express
emotions very readily, bad at reading emotions in other people. They
have extremely structured life. This is due to elevated resting
metabolism in frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrill seekers and sociopaths e.g. have lower levels. For them it
takes more work to regulate (i.e. more frontal cortex gets involved).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relation-to-amygdala&quot;&gt;Relation to amygdala&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amygdala can regulate frontal cortex (both have inhibitory
projections). There is inverse correlation in activity. Without
frontal cortex amygdala can’t learn to stop being afraid. They can
work together e.g. when a harder behavior is scary (e.g. running
towards the enemy in a war).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-parts&quot;&gt;Other parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Septum - inhibits aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lateral hypothalamus - predatory behavior (food acquisition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anterior cingulate - empathy (feeling pain of others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Green did the following test. Imagine you are a group of people
hiding from enemy in a war and you have a crying baby in the group.
Do you kill the baby? People who activate anterior cingulate less are
more likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Green also did runaway trolley problem. You choose between “not
doing anything - 5 people die” and “pull a lever or push a person with
your hands - 1 person dies”. 75% are willing to pull the lever. Only
25% are willing to push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is transmagnetic stimulation which allows to turn parts of
frontal cortex on, this leads to more utilitarian and more selfish
decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract-concepts&quot;&gt;Abstract concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of metaphors in our life, e.g. reputation, plagiarism.
However, we treat abstract concepts like real. E.g. the following
study. One in an elevator. Another person comes with a drink in a cup
and a bunch of books and asks the first person to hold the cup. There
may be a warm or a cold drink there. Afterwards the first person rates
the personality of the second person warmer if the drink was warm.
I.e. we intermix warmth metaphor with actual temperature. In other
words, metaphor storage is based on hijacked pathways for storing
temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see something disgusting (e.g. rotted food), insular cortex
activates. When you hear a story of someone powerful mistreating
someone else (in a really exploitative rotten manner), the same area
also activates. In other words, it handles cases of food being bad,
moral &amp;amp; self disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This even can be seen in the language, e.g. “I am &lt;em&gt;disgusted&lt;/em&gt; by
what you did”. Also “nauseous”, “smells rotten” - i.e. terms intermix
sensory disgust with moral disgust. I.e. moral disgust is shoehorned
in this part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People thinking of their moral failings are more likely to choose soap
as a reward afterwards to “wash their hands of their sins” (study).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one is allowed to wash their hands of their metaphorical sins, they
are less likely to help the other person who dropped books (study).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how mammalian brain does abstract thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Haidt did the following study. Ask people about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;siblings having non-reproductive sexual relationship in private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grandma asks to slap her&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;burn flag and step on it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eat your dead pet (when you are extremely hungry)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these activate insular cortex, people can’t explain what’s
wrong. I.e. cognitive decisions catch up afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are areas which activate in various contexts, e.g. for murder or
orgasm it can be increases heart rate (i.e. non-specificity of
arousal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elli Wiesel said that opposite of love is not hate, but indifference.
Love and hate are physiologically similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testosterone&quot;&gt;Testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testosterone (like in sexual behavior) is required for expressions of
aggression. The more prior experience one has, the more residual
behavior they have when testosterone is removed. Behavior drives
testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. take a rhesus monkey. They build dominance hierarchy. Pump rank 3
out of 5 with testosterone. They start beating 4 and 5 more. I.e.
testosterone only exaggerates existing social structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When testosterone is higher, amygdala threshold for a threatening face
is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testosterone shortens refractory period of single neurons in amygdala.
I.e. it does not cause anything, it only amplifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hyenas&quot;&gt;Hyenas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spotted hyenas - females dominate males. They are bigger, more
muscular, more aggressive, have more testosterone, androgenization.
Clitoris has size of male penises. They are hormonally more male than
males are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most lions starve to death in the first year of life, because the
order to eat is males, females, cubs. In hyenas it is cubs, females,
males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In primates, when one tries to dominate they get an erection. In
hyenas males get erections when they are terrified (this is
subordinate gesture). Low ranking females also get clitoral erections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecturer told a story about his friend getting invited to a
conference on predatory behavior organized by the military. The
explanation was that they wanted to teach tank corps to hunt like
carnivores (in a good tank). The exact reason is not known.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Aggression - part 2.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Human Behavioral Biology” - course summary (lecture 17)</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-17-human-sexual-behavior" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Human Behavioral Biology&quot; - course summary (lecture 17)" /><published>2020-01-25T19:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-25T19:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lecture_17_human_sexual_behavior</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-17-human-sexual-behavior">&lt;p&gt;Human Sexual Behavior - part 3 &amp;amp; Aggression - part 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is female-female competition in pair bonding species, since male
takes care of the kids (if he believes that he is the father). A
female wants a male, who is good at this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are species (e.g. New World monkeys) where females are more
aggressive than males and have larger bodies. I.e. exactly opposite to
the majority of species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evolution-of-homosexuality&quot;&gt;Evolution of homosexuality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimated homosexuality rate is from 5% to 20% (across all human 
cultures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 theories (all based on the assumption of genetic component
of sexual orientation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;heterozygotic-vigor argument&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gender dependent genetic argument - sisters of gay men have higher
than average reproductive rate&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helper at the nest - homosexual individuals spend resources on
helping their siblings and, thus, pass their genes indirectly. In
other words both sisters and brothers of homosexual siblings should
have increased reproductive rates (this has been observed).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-good&quot;&gt;Looking good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facial-symmetry&quot;&gt;Facial symmetry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 19th century there was a theory of “criminal face”. They overlapped
faces of criminals and produced a composite face. Everyone perceived
this face as very good looking. When you average faces, they look more
attractive than the individuals they came from. The more faces there
are in the composite, the more attractive it is perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation - you get highly symmetrical face. Symmetry is a good
reliable marker of health. Wildly asymmetrical faces are typically
results of developmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can pick up astonishingly subtle asymmetries in faces. Two
months old babies already prefer to look at pictures of more
symmetrical faces. This is also observed in other species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a study, which has shown that people with more symmetrical
faces are better dancers. They recorded people dancing and removed all
features of a person (e.g. replaced with a 3D model). Other people
rated the resulting dances. Dances of people with more symmetrical
faces (the faces were not shown to the raters) were rated higher.
Possible explanation: people with more symmetrical faces are more
attractive, thus, treated better, thus, more confident, thus, more
comfortable dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women faces at ovulation become a bit more symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secondary-sexual-characteristics&quot;&gt;Secondary sexual characteristics.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a handicap principle from Zahavi. Individuals show through
secondary sexual characteristics that they have so much energy that
they can afford to spend it on such not immediately useful features.
Such features are also often markers of health and immune system (lots
of evidence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Marsupial mice - males with more dramatic secondary characteristics
have more fertile sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study - the better a western country is doing (life expectancy,
economy, quality of life), the less bias women have for secondary
sexual characteristics in males (big jaw,  high forehead, better
developed muscles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can also detect whether other individual is infectious via
secondary sexual characteristics. Many such characteristics advertise
having no communicable diseases. Many species are good at detecting
smells of parasitic infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also cheating - a selection to uncouple these characteristics
from one’s health. In birds, one observes sick animals spending too
many calories on developing their secondary sexual characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem with all such research - intensity of such characteristics
has to reflect quality of immune system. Facial coloration linearly
depends on immune system. However, in vultures - one gets carotenoids
for face coloration by eating ungulate feces. They also contain a lot
of parasites. This way they say “see, I can handle so many infections,
thus, my DNA must be really good”. This is a controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lions are highly tournamental species. Black mane in males is the most
attractive and the most expensive to develop. However, your head heats
up more, so you have to balance the attractiveness of your mane with
spending more energy on your thermo regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some such characteristics are direct markers of fertility. In primates
females have external swellings when ovulating. Humans are concealed
ovulators. Some baboon females have bigger swellings than other. Male
baboons prefer larger swellings. They are a marker of estrogen levels.
Females with larger swellings have better infant survival rate.
However, it is also a handicap, one can gain 25% more weight due to
water retention for the swelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In humans there is waist-hip ratio. The bigger this ratio is, the
better the fertility is. However, in more traditional societies you
don’t see this preference that much. Perhaps this is just a bias of
western culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human males - larger jaws &amp;amp; high foreheads, more developed muscle
mass - markers of testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounder faces of men are perceived as more likable, more honest, more
trustworthy, but less desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When women ovulate, they prefer more expressed secondary sexual
characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is another problem with this line of reasoning. Let’s
say a female gazelle mates with a male with amazing secondary sexual
characteristics and gets a kid. She will expand more calories to take
care of the kid, because it has great reproductive potential. In birds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;larger eggs when mating with more attractive males. In other words,
a female makes this a self fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also females take into account how other females perceive males. Lee
Gugatkin did a study looking at female rejecting males. After a
rejection, fake female birds were placed around the male to make him
look really popular. The rejecting female was than more likely to do
solicitive courting. In other words she is jumping in a band wagon:
“If I don’t find him attractive, but others do, these traits must be
actually good and I want them in my kids”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pair bonding species males show that they can be a good parent.
Thus, there are markers of parenting skills. In non-pair bonding
primates, females with kids are more preferred, since this is a marker
of parental competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homogamy&quot;&gt;Homogamy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals like other individuals, who are more similar to them.
E.g. in the US for marriages there is 90% likelihood to share same
religion, 3 year age window, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status
during childhood, political views. 40% for IQ and education. 20-40% -
same percentile of height (taken per gender), weight, hair color, lung
capacity, width of nostrils, width of eyes (probably markers for race
and ethnicity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us again to kin selection. Mating with third to fourth
cousin is optimal and also improves fertility. I.e. you should share
great-great-grandparents (grand parents of your grandparents) or
great-great-great-grand parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In agricultures villages people in marriages originally lived less
than 10 kilometers away. In Iceland people are not more than 6th
cousin apart and they have clear records going back centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children have optimal survival rate in third-fourth cousin marriages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US people make less homogenous choices when they are younger.
This illustrates that people get more close minded as they get older.
There is an exception for religion, there is a second peak of
likelihood to enter non-homogenous marriage around 50-60 years old.
Such people often have already been living for a long time together.
One possible explanation - they wait for their parents to die, in
order not to disappoint them with such a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commonalities-across-cultures&quot;&gt;Commonalities across cultures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every single cultures women are more likely than men to want older
males. Men - younger females. Women look at economic prowess, men -
fertility markers. This is researched by David Buss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are also cliches. Because in all cultures across sexes there is
the same top ranked preference to wind up with someone who is nice to
you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aggression&quot;&gt;Aggression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You learn when to be aggressive, e.g. brutally tackling an aggressive
football player is perceived much better than doing the same to Nelson
Mandela. We welcome violence when it is of the right kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aspects which were considered unique to humans, but are not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Killing for pleasure. There is competitive infanticide. First
observed in langur monkeys by Sara Hardy. Initially people explained
this as a psychopathology and caused by humans invading their habitat.
Jane Goodall observed killings in chimpanzees. They even make weapons
and have organized violence. All adult males in the group are
relatives, so they have cooperative aggression and border patrols.
They get extremely excited and start patrolling their territory. When
encountering a male from a different group, they will kill him. There
are cases of male chimps systematically killing males of neighboring
groups, i.e. genocide (killing because of the group one belongs to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// While looking up this topic, I encountered “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe_Chimpanzee_War&quot;&gt;Gombe Chimpanzee
War&lt;/a&gt;” article
in Wikipedia with casualties and commanders. I was surprised. Looks
like this was observed by Goodall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reconciliation - doing something affiliative after aggression. Frans
de Waal studies this. Observed in rhesus monkeys, dolphins, whales,
gorillas - social grooming after fight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odds of reconciliation increase when the relationship is more
important (e.g. in macaque). E.g. pairs which had history of
cooperation (like bringing food together to a cage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be gender differences - e.g. in baboons only females
reconcile. In bonobos they have sex instead of grooming. One also
requires aggression for reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;empathy - chimps, lab rats (studied by Frans de Waal). If a male is
attacked by a more dominant male - an innocent bystander (i.e. not
picking a fight) is far more likely to be groomed by females
afterwards than the one who picked up the fight with more dominant
male. Rats send ultrasonic alarm calls when restrained. Rats who hear
the alarm have lower pain threshold, but only when the rat producing
the alarm is e.g. their cage mate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sense of justice. Chimps - after a cooperation in which one chimp
gets the food, that chimp is more likely to share the food.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dominance hierarchies. Top down - single (despotic) most aggressive
individual with uneven resource distribution due to threats, e.g.
baboons, chimps, rhesus monkeys. Bottom up (egalitarian) - (e.g.
velvet monkeys) - number one cooperates with everyone, if they get
abusive - they get overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rough-and-tumble play. In famine times this is the last of behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to disappear in kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sado- &amp;amp; masochism (due to confusing sex behavior with aggression).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;unusual domains of empathy. E.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBqhIVyfsRg&quot;&gt;an Ikea
ad&lt;/a&gt;, showing a lamp being
thrown out causing empathy reaction to the lamp and then “What’s wrong
with you, it is just a lamp, a new one also works better”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;being passive aggressive, killing indirectly (e.g. by releasing a
bomb or looking away). E.g.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a 5 year old child broke other kid easter egg and then was
  forced by paint a new one. They painted it completely black
  (complied with the requirement, but still were aggressive).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Professor’s wife. Once she was driving and they were cut off by
  someone. His wife started following that person and eventually
  reached them on a long red light. She came to the window and
  threw a lollipop inside with “Anyone who does something like
  that, needs this”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Nevada, many men every day wake up, kiss their family and go
  to work to control drone airplanes in Iraq killing people
  thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extreme empathy&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“I will let no man to spoil my soul by causing me to hate him.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sister Helen Prejean: “the less forgivable the act is, the more
  it must be forgiven”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tricky-aspects-of-studying-aggression&quot;&gt;Tricky aspects of studying aggression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Paras monkeys - no male fights in nature. Put two in a cage -
they will fight to death. Their social structure is built around
keeping males as far as possible from each other (the tension is
high), thus, they live in very dispersed patterns. Are they non-
aggressive (no fights) or extremely aggressive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripping other individual to shreds can be an aggression or getting
dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanisms-in-the-brain&quot;&gt;Mechanisms in the brain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One second before a violent act in the brain - limbic system plays
important role. E.g. amygdala. Individuals with destroyed amygdala are
incapable to elicit aggression. In humans there were court ordered
amygdalectomies in 60-70s. They would decrease aggression and a lot of
other stuff. Basically there wouldn’t be a whole lot of a person left
afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also stimulation evidence - produces wildly aggressive
behavior. There is rare epilepsy in amygdala. Normally epileptics
observe some signs of coming seizure - can be odor, seeing math
equations, auditory. When amygdala is affected - people become
extremely furious. Charles Whitman - mass murdered in 1962, was found
to have a tumor in his amydgala. In 1970s there was Baader Meinhof
gang in Germany, one of them had a tumor in her amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One’s amygdala activates when you evoke anger in someone. It also gets
bigger in PSTD victims, which leads to increased frequency of violent
behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with lesions in this area are very bad at detecting faces,
which express anger. They are more trusting than average and more
likely to forgive. There is a study by Antonio Damasio showing that
such people don’t look at eyes of other people. In other words
amygdala is able to direct you to look for aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Human Sexual Behavior - part 3 &amp;amp; Aggression - part 1.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Human Behavioral Biology” - course summary (lecture 16)</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-16-human-sexual-behavior" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Human Behavioral Biology&quot; - course summary (lecture 16)" /><published>2020-01-18T08:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-18T08:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lecture_16_human_sexual_behavior</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-16-human-sexual-behavior">&lt;p&gt;Human Sexual Behavior - part 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pheromone-effects&quot;&gt;Pheromone effects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many pheromones are breakdown products of sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women preference for the smell of males gets more dramatic around the time of ovulation
(and they become more sensitive to this smell as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men rate women sweat generally unpleasant, but it is the least unpleasant around ovulation.
The same for pheromones (but testosterone dependent phenomenon) - men prefer pheromones derived from women
around ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wellesley effect - ability of females to synchronize each other cycles (this is done via pheromones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rodents, smell of an adult female delays onset of puberty of younger females (gene competition).
For males, the effect depends on the relative ranks of males involved. When smelling higher rank male,
the lower rank male testosterone levels can go down (again gene competition mechanism). In some species,
this leads to sudden burst of sperm production instead (counter strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female’s puberty can occur faster due to male smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can induce ovulation via sensory stimuli in some species, e.g. pigs. 
One can buy ovulatory pheromone - boarmate. The same pheromones are found in truffles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a paper from anonymous author, which looked at author’s testosterone levels (male) when
close to their significant other and in other city. Facial hair growth was used as a proxy.
After shaving, the author weighted stubble. The result was a step function with high levels
when close to significant other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level of relatedness has impact on all these pheromone based effects. E.g. when a male smells his sister,
no testosterone increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these mechanisms under different sexual orientation work like in an opposite gender. E.g. homosexual men prefer
other men smell (and the more testosterone the donor has, the stronger the preference is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animals can lick each other private parts (e.g. dogs, giraffe) to get more info via pheromones via
gustatory channel (i.e. taste).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human female voices get a little bit higher around ovulation (auditory priming) and this is 
detectable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these effects are subliminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impacts-on-libido&quot;&gt;Impacts on libido&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To drive down libido, terrify individual. 
Fear and extreme rage suppress reproductive behavior as well as chronic stress.
Short term stress can stimulate (e.g. in males, e.g. during warfare leading to
violent sexual behaviors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coolidge effect - take sexually sated male (i.e. he decided that he mated enough),
put him together with a different female and he will start mating again.
Variety is simulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-term-hormonal-impact&quot;&gt;Long term hormonal impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In species which ovulate at a specific time of the year, proceptive female behavior 
highly depends on whether they ovulate. In such species, likelihood to have sex
is almost a step function around ovulation. In non-human primates this is
like a smoothed-out step function, i.e. with softer edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In humans it is similar, but there is a second peak around 28th day of the cycle.
This can be explained by females worrying less of unwanted pregnancy.
Likelihood to have orgasm follows the same shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In women sexual arousal increases around time of ovulation. They act a bit differently
in terms of proceptive signaling around the time of ovulation. E.g. wear more provocative
clothing (as assessed by both men and women).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/cycle_effects_on_tips.pdf&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Miller et al (Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers:
economic evidence for human estrus)&lt;/a&gt;
about impact of ovulation on lap dancers tips. The tips were larger (335$ for 5 hours vs 
260$ during luteal phase vs 185$ during menstruation phase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is achieved via estrogen increase of receptors for progesterone
(i.e. brain gets more sensitive to progesterone and this increases
rewarding aspects of sex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also oxytocin is synthesized, which makes women feel more affilative
with someone they had sex with around the time of ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estrogen also has effects on body - it becomes more sensitive to touch around ovulation.
Olfactory sensitivity increases too. All of this creates bias towards males around ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testosterone-in-males&quot;&gt;Testosterone in males.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For males - testosterone is the driving force.
However, there is only correlative evidence. When males mate (e.g. specific time of the year),
testosterone levels are higher. Over one’s life span testosterone levels reach peak around puberty
and from 30 cascade down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More sexually active men tend to have higher testosterone levels (correlative studies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a dramatic drop of testosterone when becoming a father (and increase of vasopressin,
i.e. bonding).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you castrate a hamster (i.e. remove testosterone), sexual activity drops, but not to 0
(residual sexual behavior).
When you reintroduce a normal level of testosterone, sexual activity goes back to normal.
The more sex experience an individual has before castration, the more residual
sexual behavior there will be (i.e. this is driven by social experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you reintroduce 10% or 200% of normal testosterone levels, sexual activity goes back to normal.
I.e. testosterone is necessary for sexual activity, but exact levels are not that important.
1000% level is supraphysiological (out of normal range) and leads to increase in sexual behavior
and arousal (e.g. when applying anabolic steroids for muscle mass). Body tries to downregulate
receptors in this case (this is only partially successful).
As we will see later, the same applies to aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, testosterone is playing a modulatory role. 
I.e. it sensitizes one towards stimuli, but not evocative of sexual arousal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;melatonin&quot;&gt;Melatonin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tells body what time of the year it is (based on amount of light).
One of driving forces for seasonal mating.
There is a smidgen of evidence in humans for seasonal mating variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact-of-early-life&quot;&gt;Impact of early life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perinatal factors - before birth. Prenatal - after birth. Postnatal - very early development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early experience is not about learning how to be sexual (these are fixed action patterns),
but for appropriate social context. Same will apply to aggression later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1950s there were studies about captive primates and consequences of growing up
in certain degree of social isolation. In therms of sex behavior, it was normal,
but in totally wrong context (e.g. towards towel or bowl of food or fully ignoring social dominance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were studies of Kibbutz communities - if you spend a lot of time with someone before age of 6,
you subliminaly stop treating them as a potential mate (like imprinting), but instead like a sibling,
i.e. pseudo kin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before people thought that early experience in life affects sex orientation.
There were 2 models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;absence of father figure model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neurotic mother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, currently there is no evidence for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prenatal-hormonal-effects&quot;&gt;Prenatal hormonal effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormones have so called organizational effects early in one’s life (i.e. on their brain and nervous system).
Later they have activation effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rodents there are massive organizational effects.
E.g. if female rhesus monkey fetus is affected by testosterone, this masculinizes their brain.
If later in life there are no other impact, this has no effect.
However, when testosterone is injected later in life, she exhibits male fixed action patterns.
This is another example of “if-then” clause - iff masculinized brain, testosterone has effect.
In all other variations (i.e. testosterone on not masculinized brain or no testosterone with masculinized brain)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In humans androgenization of females can happen too:
E.g. due to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;congenital adrenal hyperplasia (overactive adrenal system)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drug in 1950s - diethylstilbestrol (DES). In some cases fetus body converted 
this to androgens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to higher chances of becoming a lesbian in adulthood.
However, the mechanism may be not obvious. E.g. androgenized female
has intersexual genitals. They have to go through re-constructive
plastic surgeries. This can affect the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testosterone-mechanism&quot;&gt;Testosterone mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testosterone can be converted to estrogen inside cell (intracellular phenomenon,
one needs special enzyme for this conversion).
This conversion happens e.g. in brain.
In genitals and gender-specific skin parts testosterone is converted to DHT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not all female fetuses get androgenized (since their mother body has estrogen)?
There is a special protein (alpha fetoprotein) during pregnancy which binds estrogen 
and degrades it. I.e. the only fetuses that have estrogen inside their neurons
are males and estrogen comes from testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already mentioned testicular feminized males before. Phenotypically a girl, but
does not hit puberty, no menstruation. In the end she happens to be a testicular feminized male.
The individual is chromosomally male and has underdeveloped testis. This is caused by mutation
in testosterone receptor. Sexual identification is female, but the body has
masculinized organization effects. As a result, the individual is just like a normal woman,
who can’t get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;genes&quot;&gt;Genes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genes determine which gonads you make as a fetus and gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain degree of heritability for sex orientation.
E.g. in twin studies - a given mono-zygotic twin has 50% chance to be homosexual if other twin is 
homosexual. For dizygotic it is 22%, for sibling - 9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean Hamer had a paper about genetic markers for sexual orientation.
Media immediately screamed about “the gay gene”.
However,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this is not a gene, but a genetic marker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is no consistency, each pair of siblings have this marker in a different location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this was never replicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belief that sexual behavior is for the good of species is wrong as we discussed in previous lectures.
There was a belief that sexual behavior is about reproduction, but there are plenty of examples
of non-reproductive sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. bonobo chimps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no sexual dimorphism (-&amp;gt; low degree of aggression)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;female dominance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a lot of sex -&amp;gt; the most sexually promiscuous species on Earth. Majority non-reproductive:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;no ovulation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;same gender&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sexual behavior which traditionally doesn’t result in eggs getting fertilized&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For them it is about promoting group cohesion, e.g. other species do
social grooming for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pregnancy-cost-asymmetry&quot;&gt;Pregnancy cost asymmetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperm does not cost a lot, but for females more effort is involved - eggs, pregnancy, postnatal care.
As a result, females are more selective who to mate with.
Usually the males are not selective in the slightest.
Exception - pair bonding species. There male can invest even more calories into a kid
(e.g. by carrying it around). This can create cuckoldry from female side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;males-controlling-female-reproductive-behavior&quot;&gt;Males controlling female reproductive behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males can control female reproductive behavior (mate guarding) as a competition with other males.
In human e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clitoridectomies (making sex less pleasant)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chastity belts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only in groups where males disappear for long periods of time (e.g. nomadic pastoralists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In animals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;copulatory plugs - semen plug hardens in vagina&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;barbed penis in flies, which male leaves (they can make a new one)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sperm competition - when mating, male biochemically decreases female sexual attractiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monogamous species have small amounts of sperm and small testis. Polygamous - large testis.
Chimps have gigantic testis when compared to body size. Humans are in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Females have counter strategies. E.g. hidden ovulation.
This is useful to decrease paternal certainty, competitive infanticide
and effectiveness of control over female (less clear when to actually control).
There can also be pseudo estrus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male-male competition for reproductive success is the leading cause of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternative-mating-strategies&quot;&gt;Alternative mating strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was believed that rank of a male predicts reproductive success (i.e. if there is N females,
N the most dominant males get to mate) - so-called linear model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is female choice (arguments against linear model).
In tournament species, males are physically able to dominate the female.
However, she can e.g. exhaust the male. E.g. walk when he tries to eat or sleep
or bring him to his worst rival. When they start fighting - run away and have
“stolen copulation” with the guy she is interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female baboons prefer baboons who are nice to them (suggestion, no strong proofs).
E.g. the ones who groom them a lot, play with infants, don’t beat them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Smuts coined a term of inter-sexual friendship in nonhuman primates based on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stolen copulations is a viable strategy for males. You don’t get injured by being top dominant male.
you live longer and, thus, have more cases of stolen copulations.
This is an alternative strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In orangutans, the alternative strategy for low ranking males is to mate against female will (i.e. rape).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low ranking male fish can pretend to be female and eventually mate with female.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Human Sexual Behavior - part 2.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Account fee on Flatex ⇒ Flatex alternatives</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/flatex-account-fee-and-alternatives" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Account fee on Flatex ⇒ Flatex alternatives" /><published>2020-01-11T09:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-11T09:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/flatex_account_fee_and_alternatives</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/flatex-account-fee-and-alternatives">&lt;p&gt;Recently Flatex shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://konto.biw-bank.de/formularcenter_bank/public/1300100.pdf&quot;&gt;an updated price PDF&lt;/a&gt;
for the new year and to my surprise there will be
an account fee starting from March. Since I have originally chosen Flatex to avoid percentage based fees
(because they &lt;a href=&quot;/post/underestimating-ter&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/a&gt; FIRE), it is the time to move away.
Let’s look where I will move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually was a great fan of Flatex. In the world, where almost all German brokers take at least 0.25% of your
transaction value, having a constant fee is a great. I definitely don’t want to give away 0.25% or 0.5% (once for buying,
once for selling) of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
my networth. This was the deciding point for me when going for Flatex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it looks like the constant fee model Flatex has chosen is actually not sustainable. They have negative
interest rate on cash since ages, but one could avoid it pretty easily by moving cash fast. Their fee structure
is a bit weird for active trading (it is super expensive, especially for non European stock exchanges). Thus,
they have likely attracted mostly ETF investors with buy &amp;amp; hold strategy. If one buys once a month, Flatex can’t
get more than 100 EUR per year from such a user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changes&quot;&gt;Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Flatex decided to change this and announced the news
right before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;degiro&quot;&gt;Degiro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatex bought Degiro. Surprise, surprise. 250M EUR (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flatex.com/fileadmin/fintech_relaunch/Public/pdf/news/2019/pm/Press_Release_flatex_to_buy_degiro.pdf&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fees&quot;&gt;Fees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yearly depot fee of 0.1% (pre-VAT).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additional 2 EUR per transaction fee for some exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VAT in Germany is 19%, thus, for each 100k EUR invested or cash with Flatex, one will have to pay 119 EUR per year.
This is not the end of the world, but unpleasant. If one has 100k EUR with them now and plans to FIRE (i.e. to hold
the assets with them for 30 or more years), they may easily pay around 3k EUR in yearly fees. This is not a show stopper for FIRE,
but just giving away 3k EUR is unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the increased per transaction fee, this does have that much impact. If one buys once a month, it is 24 EUR
per year. During FIRE, one can sell once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the new fees affect also Degiro, current Degiro clients will be &lt;em&gt;very happy&lt;/em&gt;. I personally never used Degiro,
but their fees were much lower than Flatex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives&quot;&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mind spending my time and moving away from Flatex to save 3k EUR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My criteria are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No depot fee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The broker should be doing German taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideally no percentage based fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-brokers&quot;&gt;Interactive Brokers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have an account with IB and pretty happy with them (assuming that you have 100k USD with them to avoid monthly fee
of 10 USD, it
ends up cheaper than even old Flatex pricing). However, they don’t do German taxes. I am pretty sure
that I will be able to figure our Vorabpauschale, but having an example from a broker
would make the process much simpler. For such taxes example, I don’t even mind having a German broker with percentage based buying fee (since I don’t have to buy anything, I can just keep some
assets there, but buy at IB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dkb&quot;&gt;DKB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already did &lt;a href=&quot;/post/german-brokers-overview&quot;&gt;an overview of German brokers&lt;/a&gt; and somehow
I completely missed that DKB technically has somewhat constant transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dok.dkb.de/pdf/plv_pk.pdf&quot;&gt;Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, they take 10 EUR for an order up to 10k EUR and 25 EUR for larger orders.
This does not include stock exchange fees (e.g. Fremdkosten). 
The price jump at 10k EUR is weird, it may be that splitting e.g. 20k EUR transaction in two
will save money on the transaction fee (depends on stock exchange fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 EUR is actually quite pricey. If I were with a broker taking 0.25% transaction fee,
I would need to perform 4 kEUR transaction to pay 10 EUR fee there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have saving plans and one contribution to a saving plan costs 1.5 EUR.
One can have multiple saving plans, modify them frequently. They are executed only 
once per month on a specific day. The resulting ETFs are just like normal, the only
difference is that one chooses EUR amount, not number of shares, thus, you end up
with fractional shares. Looks like selling “saving plans” follows the rules above.
Theoretically one should be able to move their depot to a broker with cheapest
selling feels before their retirement to mitigate selling fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there is no depot fee (at least so far).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have free depot transfer. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dkb.de/info/depotwechselservice/&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; to fill in
and to sent to the old broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peculiar that they used to give 0.2% per year interest for up to 100k EUR for Aktivkunden.
To become an active client, one needs to receive at least 700 EUR per month.
Since 2020, the interest rate will be only 0.01%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since DKB is also a bank, it makes sense to consider their bank benefits. Active clients don’t
pay 1.75% fee when paying in non-EUR currency (this only true for their Visa Credit Card, not Master Card).
This actually looks attractive, since I occasionally
need to pay in non-EUR and both Deutsche Bank and Ing have similar 1.75% fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;smsTan costs 0.07 EUR per SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;onvista&quot;&gt;OnVista&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can open an account here only if they are a citizen of Germany, France, Ireland, Luxembourg,
Austria or Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onvista-bank.de/files/dokumente/formulare/formularcenter/020.1-5EUR-festpreis-preis-leistungsverzeichnis.pdf&quot;&gt;Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 + 2 EUR per transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying for savings plan is 1 EUR pro transaction. Transaction volume is limited - from 50 EUR to 500 EUR.
Selling is considered an ordinary transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The account is free for existing clients. For new clients, there is a 0.5% yearly fee for amount over
250k EUR. Funny fact, the PDF says that Depot-/ Kontoführung is free (with a small note that “there is a fee
over 250k EUR, see the following section for details”). However, it looks like this affects only cash. The
original quote is [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onvista-bank.de/files/dokumente/formulare/formularcenter/020.1-5EUR-festpreis-preis-leistungsverzeichnis.pdf&quot;&gt;source, page 6, note 2&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zur Berechnung des Verwahrentgelts ermittelt die onvista bank den täglichen Saldo der Euro-Sichteinlagen auf Kontobasis. Hiervon wird der Freibetrag von 250.000,- Euro pro Konto subtrahiert. Ein positiver Restsaldo wird anschließend mit dem von der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) für die Einlagenfazilität jeweiligen tagesgültigen vorgegebenen Zinssatz multipliziert, sofern dieser Zinssatz negativ ist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sichteinlagen” is “checking account”. Looks like they try to forward negative interest rates from European Central Bank 
to the clients (i.e. it costs money OnVista to store your cash when interest rates are negative). Thus, this is not the end of the world. If I were you, I would definitely double check with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this fee was to include stocks, this would be a party stopper for me for sure.
In terms of FIRE, 250k EUR is pretty reachable. At 312.5k EUR this would become
even more expensive than Flatex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade-republic&quot;&gt;Trade Republic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New broker, which I haven’t even seen before. Looks like a “let’s disrupt everything” startup 
similar to Robinhood in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free orders (when not taking into account stock exchange fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do your German taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like they have a limited set of ETFs and stocks. Their website says 7800 stocks and ETFs.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solarisbank.com/blog/interview-how-trade-republic-is-revolutionizing-stock-trading/&quot;&gt;This interview&lt;/a&gt;
with the founder mentions 500 ETFs. It is also mentioned that they have 25 employees and 10M EUR investment
round (the article was written in July 2019). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trade-republic#section-overview&quot;&gt;Crunchbase&lt;/a&gt;
gives 17M EUR as total funding amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Republic looks attractive, but I am scared to put a sizable chuck of my FIRE portfolio there.
My timeline is very long. I agree that these folks are doing a great thing, but I am not yet
convinced that they will still exist in a couple years. This is a startup with 2 rounds of investment.
This is very early for a startup. Moreover, Robinhood has plenty of problems in the US (e.g.
the latest infinite margin bug). Disruptiveness of startups in brokerages - no, thank you!
Moreover, the set of ETFs to buy is currently limited (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/dp9mtk/place_to_buy_etfs_and_stocks_traderepublic_any/&quot;&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;
mentions only iShares ETFs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OnVista has citizenship limitations and presumably cash depot fee starting from 250k EUR.
I am worried that it may become “non-cash” too. 250k are reachable for a FIRE person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like DKB is the only option with constant buying/selling fees at this stage.
Unfortunately, their fees are quite large. Thus, one may prefer to bundle investments into 
10k EUR chunks or tinker with their saving plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already started opening DKB account. I will wait with the move until Flatex 
sends me Tax report for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep you posted with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If DKB introduces depot fee, I will then consider moving to a broker with non-constant transaction fees,
but won’t buy there anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-pointers&quot;&gt;Further pointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;r/Finanzen on Reddit has multiple related threads (mostly in German), e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/eeiyxe/flatex_wird_uninteressant_dkb_oder_onvista/&quot;&gt;DKB or OnVista when moving from Flatex?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, many people will leave Flatex and quite a few will land at DKB.
This can still be financially positive for Flatex - they may get more money in the end with 
fewer clients left (the ones who are ok with the new fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to look at a behavior. First to consider its fixed action patterns. Then step back and look at origins
for this behavior, i.e. what happened in the brain &amp;amp; environment, its stimulus. All of these at different
time scales - 1 second ago, 1 minute and up to millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a proximal mechanism for sexual behavior - it feels good (driven by sensory stimuli,
feedback and sensations). In species with only reproductive sex, pleasure depends 
on ovulation. In humans it is different (but it is still easier when estrogen levels are higher).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many species have similar fixed action patterns, e.g. lordosis reflex, pelvic thrusting, orgasm,
ejaculation. At the same time there are differences across species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed action patterns create chains of behavior:
1) Fixed action pattern of individual A is a releasing stimuli for individual B.
2) Resulting fixed action pattern of B is a releasing stimuli for individual A.
3) Loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates species specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, ethological approach is essential when studying sexual behavior.
E.g. studying female rat sexual behavior in a cage is like studying dolphin swimming in a bathtub.
In case of a female rat, there was a large belief that the role of a female rat was very passive. However,
this was caused by the cage and lack of space to run around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying in people - anonymous surveys or something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response&quot;&gt;randomized response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libido was used before, but it is now outdated. Instead in the literature one uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;attractivity (how attractive an individual is)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proceptivity (active behaviors being carried out in response to being attracted to that individual)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;receptivity (how receptive a given individual to the interest of others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow is the following. Because of attractiveness of individual A, individual B began proceptive 
behaviors, which did or did not prove to meet receptive fixed action patterns of A in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;female-orgasm&quot;&gt;Female orgasm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is present not only in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fertility does not depend on female orgasm. 
Thus, it is not necessary to increase number copies of your genes.
However, it may facilitate fertilization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;orgasm increases vaginal secretion and vaginal fluid increases sperm motility (indirect evidence)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;orgasm exhausts - a female lays horizontally - sperm does not have to swim against gravity 
(leading model)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it feels good, thus, positive reinforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, no connection between fertility and female propensity towards orgasm was observed.
There is a certain degree of heritability of propensity towards orgasm in females.
Likelihood of female orgasm depends more on a female than on a male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clitoral-orgasm&quot;&gt;Clitoral orgasm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can be spandrel - baggage from male ejaculation.
E.g. nipples are spandrels in men (women have to go through lactation, it is “expensive” to evolve
men without nipples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sexual-behavior-unique-to-humans&quot;&gt;Sexual behavior unique to humans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of behavior which are falsely believed to be unique to humans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-reproductive sex (bonobo, chimps, dolphins)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreplay (bonobo, chimps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homosexuality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quest for variety (bonobo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confusion with violence (psychopathological)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Masturbation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fantasy (baboons)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Egalitarian sex&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private setting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marriage. &amp;gt; 90% of human end up in stable relationship even across polygamous cultures. However, there is 
a lot of social monogamy, but less of sexual monogamy. In Western countries 10-40% of all children in marriage
are not from marriage husband. Note: I tried to find a proof (since this looked like a lot) and there is at
least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-paternity-myth-the-rarity-of-cuckoldry&quot;&gt;one article&lt;/a&gt;
mentioning 1-5% range instead, which feels more plausible to me. The number is hard to estimate, since fathers
who doubt their paternity are more likely to do the test. Thus, the rate can reach 10-40% if you just consider
rate at paternity testing laboratories (which is not a good proxy for general population).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Romance. Couple centuries old concept. The notion that it should last through relationship is only 30-50
years old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somewhat boring - no sex changes, not hermaphrodites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average duration of a marriage is 2-4 years, which is close to average inter-birth period
and for how long children critically depend on parents.
Thus, humans tend to be serial monogamists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;neurobiology&quot;&gt;Neurobiology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limbic system is responsible for fixed action patterns.
Different areas are relevant for different genders.
In case of female:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subsection of hypothalamus (HT). Here is a ventral medial (VMH) - hot spot for receptors for
estrogen and progesterone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midbrain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spinal pathways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medial preoptic area in HT responsible for performing. Here are receptors for testosterone &amp;amp; androgen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amygdala (sexual motivation). Thus, males confuse sexuality with aggression.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autonomic nervous system for erection (clitoral erections in females work like that too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-erection-mechanisms&quot;&gt;Types of erection mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be vascular or muscular. Vascular is based on blood flowing in and not flowing out and lasts longer.
Muscular is based on a muscle and occurs faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dimorphism-across-genders&quot;&gt;Dimorphism across genders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a similar orgasm physiology across sexes, but recovery time is different (slower for females).
E.g. for males too fast transition from parasympathetic system to sympathetic leads to premature ejaculation.
For females a failure of transition leads to inability to reach orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain also has areas, which differ across sexes, e.g.
INAH cluster in hypothalamus. Size 2:1 for men:women. One can almost identify gender by size of this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hormonal-response&quot;&gt;Hormonal response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In females having sex leads to increase of progesterone derived hormones (i.e. reinforcing pleasure).
Also without adrenal glands sexual motivation and arousal goes down in females (i.e. androgens play a role).
Oxytocin is responsible for forming attachments and pair bonds. Higher level of oxytocin leads to more trust
and cooperation (even when sprayed through nose). Neuromarketing is very interested in such topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally oxytocin is used for nursing and milk. As a result, monogamous attachment is a descendant of
neurobiology of mother-offspring attachment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For males - testosterone goes up after sex. There is no evidence for higher testosterone causing more sex activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasopressin is responsible for forming pair bonds.
Monogamous species have receptors for vasopressin on dopamine releasing neurons.
More such receptors, the faster pair bonds can be produced.
Similar in monkeys.
Humans are as usual somewhere in between on this mono-poly scale, but there are 
genetic variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mechanism is not fully understood, e.g. bonobos have monogamous receptors, but they are
hyper polygamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sexual-orientation&quot;&gt;Sexual orientation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was mentioned above, INAH area differs across genders. 
However, homosexual men have size of this area similar to hetero women.
This was discovered in a study by Simon Levay and has been replicated.
However, the brains were from AID victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also hypothalamus difference. Dr. Schwab published this and 
even got death treats from homosexual community, since this was perceived
as pathology. Levay was gay and his finding was met much better.
Partially since its connection to gender and sexuality was better understood.
This hypothalamus area just happened to be close to the area Levay discovered
(i.e. its size difference is caused by proximity to and INAH size difference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, INAH study was perceived positively, since it was showing
that orientation can not be chosen, but it is just a biology instead.
There was even a t-shirt “the only small thing about me is my sexually dimorphic nucleus” (i.e. INAH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a difference in ratio of length of 2nd finger vs 4th. Homosexual men on average tend to have 
this ratio close to straight women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otoacoustic reflex. If you close your ears, you hear oscillations and their rate differs by sex.
Homosexual men have frequency more typical of straight women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For homosexuality in women there are fewer studies. The 2nd/4th finger ratio is the same (i.e.
homosexual women have ratio of straight men) as well as otoacoustic reflex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trans-sexuality&quot;&gt;Trans-sexuality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used to be a psychiatric disorder (as well as homosexuality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a gender difference in size of bed nucleus of the stria terminals (reliable predictor for gender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transsexuals have the size of their self identified gender (i.e. not their physical gender).
This holds even for people who didn’t do gender change.
Moreover when men with testicular cancer are treated with feminine hormones, this does not change
size of this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60% of victims of penile cancer have phantom penile sensations. Transgender people, who changed
their gender from male to female get no phantom penile sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, transsexuals got a wrong gender body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dopamine&quot;&gt;Dopamine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurobiology of pleasure, anticipation and reward is common. Role of dopamine is identical across genders
and is huge. Loss of sexual interest is one of defining symptoms of clinical depression.
Mesolimbic dopamine system is central to reinforcing aspects of sexual behavior.
It is about anticipation of the reward and fueling of behaviors needed to achieve reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In males this system activates, if one finds another person attractive and there is eye contact or
the other person is not attractive and there is no eye contact. Same holds for homosexual men looking 
at pictures of other men. Sexual orientation in this mechanism is just like having other gender areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is related to uncertainty. E.g. if a monkey gets reward only in 50% of cases,
the dopamine level will be even higher than when 100% reward.
This is called intermittent reinforcement. If the rate is changed to 25% or 75%,
the level falls, but still higher than 100% (i.e. corresponds to level of uncertainty).
Thus, the goal of Las Vegas is to convince people that there is 50% change, when there is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joke: relationship is the price you pay for anticipation of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonding&quot;&gt;Bonding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are receptor subtypes D1 and D2, which are relevant for sex behavior.
In monogamous rodents, when bonding happens level of D2 goes down and D1 increases.
If D2 falls before mating, no pair bond happens.
If decrease of D2 or increase of D1 is prevented, the individuals will bond with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2 - rewarding anticipatory aspects of pair bonding
D1 - pleasure of monogamous features of pair bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human ratio of D2/D1 predicts stability of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a brain imaging study which considered couples after 2.5 weeks and after 5 years.
In the first case, just seeing their beloved one activated this dopamine system.
In the second case, anterior cingulate was activated instead (i.e. empathy, comfort)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brain-areas&quot;&gt;Brain areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex is responsible for context of sexual behavior (i.e. how to be appropriate).
This does not change fixed action patterns, but their context instead.
Damage to this area can lead e.g. to a rape in a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stimuli&quot;&gt;Stimuli&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non human primates (as well as humans) are very visual (males usually more).
As a result, they get more dopamine activation due to visual stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some tactile receptors activate more dopamine, this explains erogenous zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsiveness to stimuli also depends on hormone levels.
In women, there is more sensitivity during ovulation (especially genitals).
Overall skin is more sensitive to sexually arousing touch during ovulation.
In men testosterone is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;olfactory&quot;&gt;Olfactory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are olfactory cues, i.e. pheromones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both sexes right hormones are required to generate pheromones.
Men with low testosterone don’t generate pheromones, neither do women without ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pheromones - breakdown products of sex hormones.
Neuromarketing is also interested in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfumes are classically made of sweat of various animals (typically male).
E.g. Chanel #5 was based on sweat of whipped male Abyssinian cats.
Currently it is more synthetic and made of androgens.
The sweat is from males, because majority of perfumes are not bought by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pheromones convey a lot of info, e.g. species, gender, whether castrated or not,
health, terrified or not, family-related to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perceive pheromones, the receiver needs right hormones, e.g. castrated men don’t
distinguish sweat of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Females identify gender via pheromones even better when they ovulate.
Homosexual men are even better at detecting other homosexual men smell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Human Sexual Behavior - part 1.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Overview of this blog’s life in 2019 and plans for 2020</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/blog-summary-2019" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Overview of this blog's life in 2019 and plans for 2020" /><published>2020-01-05T14:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-05T14:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/blog_summary_2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/blog-summary-2019">&lt;p&gt;I’ve got an idea to start a blog in the end of 2018 and published the first post
in the early January of 2019. In other words, this blog is now kind of one year old.
This was not my New Year resolution, but somehow it worked out.
Let’s reflect a bit, see some stats and what I am going to do differently in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I don’t remember precisely why I wanted to start this blog. It was probably an attempt
to express myself, see what other people find interesting. However, with time these intentions
mutated greatly. Currently I consider a blog as a nice lever for doing stuff I like.
When I have an idea, I can not only do it, but also write about it on the blog
and this increases the impact of my idea. Moreover, I do enjoy writing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposed-changes&quot;&gt;Proposed changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this blog is a living organism on its own and I constantly experiment
with my approach to it. And I definitely want to continue doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of 2019 I have adopted two posts per week schedule.
My hope was that this would make the blog more interesting to regular readers.
I also usually scheduled 1 hour per post for writing and ~30 minutes for after-baking
modifications (if you are confused by “baking”, I’ve described the process 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/how-i-write-this-blog&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). And as people often say -
“you get what you measure”. As a result, many of my posts are rather short and somewhat shallow.
I did do a couple posts which took much longer than allocated and I did enjoy working on them a lot
(e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;/post/luckiest-investor-or-investing-when-knowing-the-future&quot;&gt;luckiest investor&lt;/a&gt;).
Also it looked like others found such posts more interesting as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am going to try to have no schedule from now on.
As well as no time allocation per post. This means that I may “disappear” for longer,
but eventually come back with much deeper posts (and hopefully of better quality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way I hope to preserve the part of the blog which I like (writing deep posts
and exploring the topic well) and to get rid of less interesting parts (having to post something
twice a week). The former was always a pure flow. The latter definitely felt like a chore sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I somewhat implicitly used to optimize for quantity. Quality might
have been implicitly sacrificed. Again, this was all implicit, I just wanted regularity.
Now I will try to optimize for quality and very likely quantity will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expected-challenges&quot;&gt;Expected challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already see one possible issue with my new approach. 
I am quite a perfectionist and having strict deadlines helps me to fight that.
However, without a schedule, I might polish a post forever.
I am not sure how to counter that, perhaps some upper bound time limit
per post. In any case, I will try to split the posts into smaller chunks
and to publish them sooner this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics&quot;&gt;Topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope that the new approach will change topic allocation of my posts.
Due to allocated time limit in 2019 I often did write personal reflections on 
various topics. This is not bad per-se, but it is often very anecdotal,
doesn’t have any proof and not that rigorous. I hope that with the new approach
I will do more coding, simulations, deep rigorous posts with citations and
sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now let’s look back and see how 2019 went for this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started time tracking in March and overall I spent at least 120 hours since then.
This is clean time (i.e. just me actively doing something blog related) and might be a lower
bound. This also includes various non-writing activities, e.g. Jekyll related fixes, actually posting stuff,
updating twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this feels less than I expected.
Overall there were 76 posts in 2019, 8 of which were before March.
Thus, we are left with 68 posts in 120 hours or 1 hour 45 minutes per post.
Funny enough this matches very closely my time allocation of 1 hour for writing
and ~0.5 hour for after-baking corrections. Unfortunately, I don’t have time tracking with per 
post granularity, but I definitely remember that there was a lot of variation.
Some posts did take 7-10 hours (very few though), some more like 10-20 minutes.
After-baking fixes often took 5-10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now analyze the posts themselves and build various graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-counts&quot;&gt;Post counts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at posts published over day of week, we definitely see my chosen Tuesday - Sunday schedule.
Closer to the end of the year, I replaced Sunday with “weekend”, so that explains the Saturday’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/1_posts_per_day_of_week.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar plot of #posts published per day of week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking per month only October is unusual. Unfortunately I was traveling and didn’t have much chance to write.
It is peculiar to observe me ramping up in January and February and reaching steady state in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/2_posts_per_month.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar plot of #posts published per month&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at number of posts published per day for the entire year, we can definitely
see how I started with no schedule and then in March switched to 2 posts per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/3_posts_per_day.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar histogram #posts published per day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;characters-published&quot;&gt;Characters published&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity I just look at file sizes, which may be different from number of characters one observes
on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at average post size in characters per day of week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/4_average_characters_per_day_of_week.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar plot of average #characters per post per day of week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow magically Thursday happens to have the longest average post.
Actually there are only 2 posts on Thursdays - 
&lt;a href=&quot;/post/underestimating-ter&quot;&gt;“Underestimating TER”&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;/post/thought-experiment-7-true-happiness&quot;&gt;“Thought experiment #7 about true happiness”&lt;/a&gt;
, both of which are 11-12k characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longest post is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review&quot;&gt;the review of “The science of wellbeing” course&lt;/a&gt;. 34411 characters, I am not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortest one is about &lt;a href=&quot;/post/interactive-brokers-monthly-fee&quot;&gt;interactive brokers monthly fee&lt;/a&gt;, 1657 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/book-summary-the-dip&quot;&gt;the summary of “The dip”&lt;/a&gt; with
7505 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at a histogram of post sizes, we can see that almost all posts are up to ~15k characters
with only few outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/5_post_sizes_histogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Histogram of post sizes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at characters published per day over entire year:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/blog_summary_2019/6_characters_per_day.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar histogram #characters published per day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some variation, but nothing peculiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;words&quot;&gt;Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top 10 most common words with their occurrence counts (case sensitive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘to’ - 2970&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘the’ - 2749&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘and’ - 2028&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘a’ - 1940&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘is’ - 1925&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘I’ - 1815&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘of’ - 1715&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘you’ - 1358&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘in’ - 1278&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘this’ - 1161&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny that there is so much “I”, but fortunately “you” is not that far back.
This quite matches the general distributing in English (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000&quot;&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt;). There you get 1.94 “I” for each “you”, 
while in this blog it is 1.33. In other words, it is more about you than an average English text. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I suspect that I sometimes don’t use “the” where I should (the count is lower
than on average in English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notable mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘time’, 450 occurrences, rank 27 vs 69 in English&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘people’, 369, rank 40 vs 135&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘something’, 259, rank 63 vs 219 (I should try using this less frequently)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘FIRE’, 218, rank 69 vs 351 (for ‘fire’)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘life’, 206, rank 74 vs 114&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘money’, 159, rank 96 vs 271&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this illustrates well what this blog is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;popularity&quot;&gt;Popularity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post with the most unique pageviews is 
about &lt;a href=&quot;/post/interactive-brokers-fixed-vs-tiered-commissions&quot;&gt;fixed vs tiered Interactive Brokers commissions&lt;/a&gt;.
It also has the largest average time spent on the page.
Somehow people find this topic very interesting.
I myself was also confused by all the intricate details and that’s why I decided to write the post
in the first place. I definitely didn’t expect it to become that relatively popular.
It also gets the most interest in search engines and badly dominates all
search clicks and queries. What a peculiar world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runner up in unique pageviews is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/luckiest-investor-or-investing-when-knowing-the-future&quot;&gt;luckiest investor&lt;/a&gt;.
This one was peculiar and I did expect it to pique some interest.
This post also became my by far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmnbyb/the_luckiest_investor_of_2018_or_how_much_you/&quot;&gt;most popular post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;afterword&quot;&gt;Afterword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is 2019 for “Merely Curious”.
I am definitely looking forward to build similar graphs for 2020 after getting rid of publishing schedule.
There must be much less structure there and, thus, observations to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to you all for motivating me!
You are very welcome to contact me, I am definitely not overwhelmed
by reader communication at this point.
See my email and twitter below.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/merely_curious_&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; would do too if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s reflect a bit, see some stats and what I am going to do differently in 2020.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Human Behavioral Biology” - course summary (lecture 14)</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-14-limbic-system" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Human Behavioral Biology&quot; - course summary (lecture 14)" /><published>2019-12-21T13:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-12-21T13:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/human_behavioral_biology_sapolsky_course_summary_lecture_14_limbic_system</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/human-behavioral-biology-sapolsky-course-summary-lecture-14-limbic-system">&lt;p&gt;Limbic System. Finally we get closer to emotions and this gets super interesting fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limbic system is a part of brain, which is involved in emotions, but does not get much interest e.g. in
medical schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rats olfactory bulb is a large part of the brain. Its signals are processed in limbic system. Rat’s emotional
world is driven by olfactory information. In birds it is more based on sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;triune-brain-model&quot;&gt;Triune brain model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ancient, archaic part. Hypothalamus talks to pituitary, so called reptilian part. It is responsible for purely
automatic regulation. E.g. monitors and controls temperature, blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ondine’s curse - stroke damage to this area. As a result no capacity for automatic breathing. Affected
person dies of sleep deprivation. One can’t fall asleep, because then they don’t breathe and get at
the edge of asphyxiation and wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[On top] Limbic system - mostly mammalian.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[On top] Cortex. Greatly expanded in primates and especially in humans. Cortex can be influenced by other two
systems or influence them (e.g. emotional/physiological response after thinking about future death).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subparts-of-limbic-system&quot;&gt;Subparts of limbic system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We say that parts are &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt;, when neurons located in that part have axons in the other part (i.e. this area
&lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; into the other area).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire limbic system is structured around how to influence hypothalamus. Each part tries to inhibit other parts
and tell hypothalamus what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fewer hops (synapses in-between) to hypothalamus some projection has, the better control that part has
(faster, neurons downstream don’t affect the signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olfactory system is the only system, which is only 1 synapse away from limbic system. All other sensory
systems have minimum 3 synapses (e.g. layer responsible for detecting dots and lines in visual signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amygdala - cluster of neurons. Means almond in Greek. Responsible for fear, anxiety, aggression. 
Thus, there is connection between fear and aggression. Also covers male sexual motivation. This partially explains
why one can confuse sex behavior and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Septum - inhibits aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypocampus - handles memory &amp;amp; turns off stress response. This combination (memory &amp;amp; stress) in one center is
important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;saving how you got away from a stress situation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when ending up in the same situation, retrieving how you fixed it last time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mammillary bodies - maternal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PFC - cortical component of limbic system. It is responsible for impulse control, postponing gratification,
long-term planning, learning appropriate sexual behavior, how not to be aggressive and when to be.
PFC is larger in humans (that’s what makes us humans). It is only recently evolved and
also the last part of the brain to fully mature (not fully myelinated until mid 20s).
Best predictor for ratio of PFC over entire brain is size of species social group. I.e. PFC is important
for gossip, social intelligence, appropriate behavior.
Part of PFC is anterior cingulate - empathy (related to clinical depression).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VFA - depression, release dopamine -&amp;gt; pleasure. All addictive drugs (e.g. cocaine) affect this area.
This activates when you anticipate getting pleasure (i.e. not getting the reward itself, but just
anticipation). As a result, this powers the behavior to get the reward.
Motivation for pursuing pleasure is more addictive than pleasure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothalamus - sexual behavior. Size depends on sexual orientation (e.g. transgender people have
configuration of self-identified gender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCN - circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PT - makes CRH, i.e. stress response. All other parts send projections here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LHT - hunger. Measures glucose and insulin in blood. Also hunger for other rewards than food, e.g. other types 
of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-to-study-limbic-system&quot;&gt;Ways to study limbic system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Evolution is not an inventor, it is a tinkerer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warfare is a good source of subjects for brain experiments (there are often casualties, which lead to removal
of parts of the brain). After a war, neuroscientists get their careers jump-started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. patient NA, who had their septum taken out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;N.A. has been amnesic since 1960 when at the age of 22 years he sustained a penetrating brain injury with a miniature fencing foil.
Source: Description of brain injury in the amnesic patient N.A. based on magnetic resonance imaging. Squire LR et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobotomy - “intentional” brain damage (e.g. cutting off limbic structures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray matter - nuclei, cell bodies, white matter - cables of axons wrapped in myelin (they do actually
have these colors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental animals - destroy part of the brain, look what does not work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put an electrode in a brain region and stimulate it (i.e. provide an input signal there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put a recording electrode and see when that area is excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is possible to record one neuron and even one ion channel of a neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way one can find out which parts of the brain send their signals into a particular area and how many
hops it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imaging brain regions (CT scan, CAT, MRI, functional brain imaging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hard to distinguish centers from fibers of passage. I.e. did one destroy a center responsible for some
function or a passage which carries this signal? One can imagine that we want to find out source
of garlic, that brings garlic to Stanford. And we can do this only by carpet-bombing. Eventually garlic
stops coming to the campus. Did we destroy the garlic farm or a highway?
Sometimes fibers can pass very close to nuclei (no way to destroy only one of them).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is a center in the brain? Everything is highly intermixed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to know your species (i.e. to know ethology). 
Let’s say you put stimulating electrode and observe a lion extending its claw.
When you do the same to a human, they start cursing. I.e. this is irritation
and lion just expressed it this way. Another example is a rat running around and
collecting pieces of a newspaper. When the same is done to a rhesus monkey,
it grabs something cylindrical and hugs it. This is nursing behavior.
It is also difficult to distinguish aggression from food acquisition (e.g. a rat attacking a mouse after
a stimulation). This can also vary across individuals even in the same species, e.g. in case of portraying dominance,
a subordinate won’t do power display (even when this area is stimulated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-lange-theory-of-emotion&quot;&gt;James-Lange theory of emotion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stimulus comes into brain. Before brain processes it, your body already responds (e.g. increased heart rate).
How do you figure out which emotion you feel? Your brain looks at changes in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an old experiment, where adrenalin was given to people without them knowing it (nowadays this
wouldn’t be allowed). Then people sit in waiting room. There is an accomplice. For one group,
the accomplice is pissed off. For another group - happy and friendly. People in the experiment
just overtook the emotion. I.e. adrenalin mediates emotion you socially observe. It does not cause
a concrete behavior, but exaggerates the emotional state provoked externally (i.e. like Gaba inhibition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, one can affect emotional state by affection body. E.g. when one is anxious, they get valium.
When one needs to relax muscles, they get something similar. I.e. to get rid of anxiety, one needs to relax,
since anxiety is based on feedback from muscle tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same with aggression. E.g. let’s say your significant other pissed you off. Then they apologize and you
accept the apology. Cognitively you have resolved the conflict, but your body is still in pissed off state.
It takes time to change the state. You can easily fall back into being angry due to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can work other way around, e.g. meditation &amp;amp; biofeedback for blood pressure control. One can find trigger
(e.g. a pleasant thought), which decreases blood pressure and by using it, make the effect even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a gender difference in how long it takes to get back to baseline (including after orgasm) - males
faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take someone in depression, force them to smile mechanically repetitively. Eventually they will start feeling better
due to this body-emotion feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peculiar motor system inefficiency. When you want to bend one particular finger, there is a system which
tells all 5 of them to bend. Then there is another system which tells other fingers: “if you receive command
‘bend’, ignore it”. This shows evolution of these systems. Many species don’t need to bend one finger, thus,
they have a system for bending all fingers (e.g. claw) at the same time. It was “easier” to add an add-on 
to allow bending one finger instead of redesigning everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some regions change size with time. Amygdala gets bigger in people with post traumatic stress disorder.
In people with long term major depression, hippocampus get smaller (atrophy).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Limbic System.

Basically we consider simplifications made during the last two
lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 3 last lectures, everything was very simple and smooth. Let’s now see ways in which everything is more
complex than it seemed (e.g. what was omitted, simplified).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuro and endocrine systems can change their function over time in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cells in pituitary gland are specialized (each produces only one hormone). However, they are mixed in terms
of location (i.e. not clustered). Moreover, how strongly a given cell reacts depends on its neighborhood.
Brain can use this to control the production better (i.e. target only specific cells in specific
neighborhood). This means that there is a communication across cells in pituitary to achieve the neighborhood
differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dales-laws&quot;&gt;Dale’s laws&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two of them, both have been disproved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: action potential of a neuron starts in its body and causes neurotransmitters to be released from every
single terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;False, you can get blockades, which prevent signal propagation in some branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: each neuron has one and only one characteristic type of neurotransmitter, that it releases through all
its terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are examples of multiple neurotransmitters in the same neuron. Peculiarly in this case every single axon terminal
contains both types of neurotransmitters (i.e. there is no division across axon terminals). There are even
examples of 3 neurotransmitters in one neuron. Usually one neurotransmitter has short effect and the other - long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple-ways-to-trigger-same-hormone-production&quot;&gt;Multiple ways to trigger same hormone production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACTH in pituitary gland can be produced due to receiving CRH or many other hormones. Brain can create different
mixtures of these. This affects the shape of ACTH production curve. It also has additional effects (i.e. not
only produces ACTH). There are also hormones inhibiting ACTH production. E.g. when one goes to sleep,
there is no need for stress hormones. Hormone profile released to produce ACTH during stress due to thinking
about “mortality” differs from stress when “burning big toe”. I.e. by having different “cocktails” the brain is
able to react differently to different stress situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quantity-regulation-feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Quantity regulation (feedback loops)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neuron&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autoreceptor - a receptor at the axon on the neuron, which binds the same neurotransmitter this neuron produces.
Every time the receptor binds something, neuron “concludes” “I released N neurotransmitter
units” (i.e. counts in a statistical way). This enables a negative feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hormones&quot;&gt;Hormones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain also measures how much of a specific hormone there is in blood. Thus, there must be brain areas counting specific
hormones. Then it can inhibit hormone production when there is enough of it (negative feedback loop). Most
feedback works by “the more of a given hormone I observe, the more I inhibit”, i.e. inhibition is proportional
to an absolute number. However, there are examples when a rate of change is measured instead. I.e. the 
faster the rate of change is, the stronger the inhibition is. In this case, increase from 10 to 12 &amp;amp;
from 10M to 12M cause the same level of inhibition. This happens at a level of pituitary gland, not brain.
Measuring rate of change is a non-obvious approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also examples of positive feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;autoregulation&quot;&gt;Autoregulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone constantly screams at you, you stop paying attention to them. Cells do the same to hormones.
If there is too much of some hormone, they decrease number of its receptors to become less sensitive.
This can happen when system fails. This may be related to depression, however people still don’t know whether
depressions is due to too much or too little serotonin (because the mechanism is so complex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diabetes&quot;&gt;Diabetes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You eat sugar, glucose ends up in blood. Pancreas secretes insulin to tell fat cells to capture sugar
from the blood. Fat cells are already full (due to western diet) and they can’t take more sugar, so they
ignore the signal. Pancreas secretes even more insulin to compensate. Fat cells decrease number of receptors.
You get a feedback loop. Fat cells become less and less sensitive and pancreas produces more and more insulin.
Eventually pancreas “burns” its insulin producing mechanism and can’t produce it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amount of the messenger is as important as cells sensitivity to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variability-in-receptor-structure&quot;&gt;Variability in receptor structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ligand - whatever the receptor binds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receptors consist of proteins, thus, are encoded using multiple genes. This creates variability. Cells can
change subunits of their receptors. This changes how well receptor does its job. E.g. an epilepsy can be
caused by cells reacting too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corticosteroids have cell type specific functions (due to having variability in subunits on the other end
of the receptor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variability-in-receptor-triggers&quot;&gt;Variability in receptor triggers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many receptors can bind more than one ligand.
E.g. Gaba binds Gaga. It is inhibitory.
It also binds the following 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;major tranquilizers (barbiturates) - that’s how anesthesia works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minor tranquilizers (Valium &amp;amp; Librium) - inhibits not that much&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;derivatives of progesterone - this has been used as anesthesia in 1950s. This may be related to mood shifts
over the course of reproductive cycle. Premenstrual syndrome = shortage of progesterone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modulation&quot;&gt;Modulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine two neurons A &amp;amp; B. A sends signal to B. When Gaba inhibits, it actually does not affect B (i.e.
how it reacts to the signal). Instead it affects terminals of A (i.e. its ability to impact B). Thus,
Gaba has effect only when A is triggered. Tranquilizers have the same modulation effect on Gaba. I.e.
they have any impact only when Gaba already has some effect (i.e. A is triggered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormones can do modulation too. E.g. CRH + Vasopressin can produce much more ACTH than just CRH alone, but
Vasopressin alone produces very little ACTH. Thus, Vasopressin just modulates effect of CRH and does not
trigger ACTH production on its own. Thus, it has effect only when CRH has effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><category term="courses" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Advanced Neurology and Endocrinology.
