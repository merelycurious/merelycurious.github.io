&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can imagine pitch as Y axis and time as X axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-durations&quot;&gt;Note durations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In western notation note duration is always expressed as fraction
of beat rather than in seconds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(illustrations are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols#Time_signatures&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semibreve (whole note in US) - full duration of one bar in 4/4 meter.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/Music-wholenote.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minim (half note) - semibreve / 2
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-halfnote.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crotchet (quarter note) - semibreve / 4
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-quarternote.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quaver (eighth note) - semibreve / 8
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-eighthnote.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semiquaver (sixteenth note) - semibreve / 16
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-sixteenthnote.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) - semibreve / 32
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-thirtysecondnote.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same we can do with pauses - rests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 - 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-wholerest.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/2 - 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-halfrest.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/4 - 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Crochet2.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/8 - 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-eighthrest.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/16 - 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-sixteenthrest.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/32 - 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-thirtysecondrest.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beams&quot;&gt;Beams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes with “flags” can be joined using a beam
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-beam.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can ease reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuplets&quot;&gt;Tuplets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally we need to subdivide rhythm differently, we can use
tuples e.g. for 3 notes in 2:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-triplet.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actually changes duration of these notes. Basically this notation
says play 3 notes in 2 quarter notes, so duration of this modified
quarter note is 2/3 of an ordinary one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extensions&quot;&gt;Extensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can extend note duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either using a tie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-tie.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be multiple ties in a row. Tie means - play the first note
with the duration = sum of all tied notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or using dotted note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-dotnote.svg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means play the note with duration = its ordinary duration + half. One can
use multiple dots, each dot adds another halved period. It is important
that the dot is on the side (dots in other locations mean other stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can mark a note using Fermata - out of time pause:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_3/100px-Music-fermata.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performer decides on their own how long the pause should be.
Rule of thumb - twice of the note duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meter&quot;&gt;Meter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;Simple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Duple - 2 beats per bar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Triple - 3 beats per bar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quadruple - 4 beats per bar (aka common time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time signature is written as a fraction. Numerator is “beats per bar”
and denominator is “beat type”. In other words denominator defines
note type (i.e. duration) by giving its bar fraction, e.g. 4 means
quarter. Numerator tells how many such notes are there per one bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats can be weak and strong. 
In 4/4 usually 1 and 3 are strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats are subdivided into two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compound&quot;&gt;Compound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats are subdivided into three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually denominator is 8 and numerator mod 3 = 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;form&quot;&gt;Form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anacrusis - unstressed notes before the first bar line of a piece (can be one note aka pickup note).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phrase - complete piece (e.g. 4 bars or one breath etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhythms are combined into beats, beats into bars, phrases,
periods, sections, movements (or songs), symphonies or concertos (or albums).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motive - is an isolated short musical phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combining-sections&quot;&gt;Combining sections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binary form - A B (usually B is in different key)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ternary - A B A or A B A’ (sonata, A’ means A modified).
Exposition -&amp;gt; development -&amp;gt; recapitulation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rondo form ABACA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is 12 bar blues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Rhythm and form.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unexpected lesson from checking portfolio in crisis</title><link href="https://merelycurious.me/post/checking-portfolio-in-crisis" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unexpected lesson from checking portfolio in crisis" /><published>2020-04-18T17:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-04-18T17:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://merelycurious.me/post/checking_portfolio_in_crisis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://merelycurious.me/post/checking-portfolio-in-crisis">&lt;p&gt;As you all know, the stock market is down. Even though I knew this,
I’ve had a peculiar experience recently, when checking my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;happiness&quot;&gt;Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I knew that everything should be 20-30% down and this was
perfectly fine with me. I obviously had nagging thoughts: “You should
time it, let’s sell, it’s going to fall more, let’s sell”, but I
successfully managed to shoo them away. Then one day I needed to log
state of my portfolio (I try to do this monthly). Once I did this,
I was surprised how much money I was missing. It was much more than
I expected. After a brief calculation, I confirmed that this was
around 25% and then I understood that I just have a lot of money.
Somehow my brain was ok with 30% down, but never translated that
into absolute amounts. Even though I was “missing” quite a chunk of my
portfolio, understanding that I had money in the first place (and I still
have quite a lot left) made me super happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson&quot;&gt;Lesson&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to find positive side. These are challenging times, but our 
hedonic adaptation will kick in very fast (mine has done so
already). In the end, it is a good opportunity to be even happier
than before, since you get a very different view. Even
small stuff like having a walk feels super cool and makes me so
happy, especially when understanding that I may have no such
opportunity in the future. The same can be applied in the future to everything you
are missing now. Meeting friends? Going to restaurants? Yeap, it
sucks, but once everything is back, it is will be super special and
pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a trick, I also suggest you to prepare yourself morally to 
living in such mode e.g. for a year or two. This way it just becomes
new normal, you get used, everything becomes fine. Once there are 
improvements you get happy, because stuff becomes better than your normal.
If you keep “when will this shit be over?” mode, this sets your mood to be negative.
Basically, you say that this is not normal and even
worse then normal and you are waiting (=suffer), i.e. unhappy. Once
it gets back to normal, you will probably feel better, but not that
much, since you just get back to your old normal.&lt;/p&gt;

Summary of week 1. So far there are a lot of stuff “just by definition”,
so I honestly felt a need to wrote a summary to structure everything in
my head (since I already forgot quite a lot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compare sounds and we call them low and high. Some sounds
we can’t sing. For the ones we can, we say they have pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We denote notes using letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
This is our music alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notation&quot;&gt;Notation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can write relative changes in pitch, but this is still ambiguous
for a reader, if they don’t know any absolute value. Thus, monks
struggled with writing down and transmitting melodies. As a result,
stave notation was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stave is based on 5 horizontal lines. A symbol on the left
is called G-clef or Treble-clef. It circles itself on line representing
note G. Each line and space between lines represent a note (a white
key on piano keyboard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_1/1_notes.png&quot; alt=&quot;stave with notes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mnemonics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spaces between lines starting from bottom - F A C E&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lines starting from bottom - Every Good Boy Deserves Fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can add additional lines when leaving stave’s range.
E.g. middle C is the first line under the stave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we have 12 pitches on guitar (i.e. also black keys on
piano keyboard) in one octave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_1/2_piano_notes.png&quot; alt=&quot;stave with notes and piano keys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_1/3_piano_notes_horizontal.png&quot; alt=&quot;stave with notes and piano keys (horizontal)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intervals&quot;&gt;Intervals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octave - interval between (and including) two notes, one having twice
or half the vibration frequency of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semitone - distance between two adjacent keys on piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tone = 2 semitones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_1/4_tones_semitones.png&quot; alt=&quot;tones and semitones on piano keys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s call one line or space in stave - a unit. 
We say that interval between two notes is “a second” if 
there are no units between them on the stave (i.e. this is a line
and its adjacent space).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is one unit - “a third” (
i.e. two lines with one space in between or two spaces with one line).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes a bit confusing part. F to G is a second. C to B is a
second. There is a black key between F and G, but not between C &amp;amp; B.
Nevertheless both are called - “a second”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scales&quot;&gt;Scales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scale - a pathway through octave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example - C Major (we just go through notes one by one)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; D &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; E &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; F &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; G &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; A &amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; B &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; is a tone and &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; is a semitone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C is called a tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequence TTSTTTS defines “quality of scale”.
This one belongs to Diatonic Scale (because it has
5 tones and 2 semitones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches in the world, this one is so called
common practice, i.e. Western Europe 1600-1900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take A as a tonic and again go through notes one by one, we get natural minor scale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; B &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; C &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; D &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; E &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; F &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; G &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.e. the sequence of T’s and S’s is different from major
This is still Diatonic Scale (still 5 T and 2 S).
The sequence itself is called Aeolian mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting from D, we get Dorian mode&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; E &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; F &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; G &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; A &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; B &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; C &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E -&amp;gt; Phrygian&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; F &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; G &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; A &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; B &amp;lt;S&amp;gt; C &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; D &amp;lt;T&amp;gt; E&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically we just traverse the stave starting from a note and write
down all the notes we meet on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F -&amp;gt; Lydian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G -&amp;gt; Mixolydian (also 5th degree of C Major, interval between C and G
is a fifth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B -&amp;gt; Locrian mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chords&quot;&gt;Chords&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a piece of natural minor scale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A B C D E&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and count semitones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lt;T - 1 2&amp;gt; B &amp;lt;S - 3&amp;gt; C &amp;lt;T - 4 5&amp;gt; D &amp;lt;T - 6 7&amp;gt; E&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do the same for C Major&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C &amp;lt;T - 1 2&amp;gt; D &amp;lt;T 3 4&amp;gt; E &amp;lt;S 5&amp;gt; F &amp;lt;T 6 7&amp;gt; G&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 semitones = perfect fifth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A -&amp;gt; C = a minor third (3 semitones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C -&amp;gt; E = a major third (4 semitones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C Major chord is C E G (C major triad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triad = three notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbreviations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C Major = C, Cmaj, CM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Minor = Amin, Am, A-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can construct a major triad by taking major third and perfect
fifth (i.e. a note 4 semitones away and a note 7 semitones away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_1/5_c_maj.png&quot; alt=&quot;c maj on piano keys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a minor triad - minor third (3 semitones) + perfect fifth
(7 semitones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_1/6_a_min.png&quot; alt=&quot;a min on piano keys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also Diminished Triad (B0 Bdim) = Minor third (3 semitones) + Diminished Fifth (6 semitones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that “third” and “fifth” are taken from the stave, but whether
it is “perfect”, “minor”, “diminished” is based on the underlying 
notes. I.e. we take C, count one stave unit, get E, count another
stave unit - get G. Now we can count semitones and identify whether
this is maj, min or dim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we repeat taking third and fifth from every note, we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cmaj Dmin Emin Fmaj Gmaj Amin Bdim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-chord-trick&quot;&gt;Three Chord Trick&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C, F and G work well together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C - tonic triad (I)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F - subdominant (IV) - the tonic is domimant of the subdomimant. It is
as far below the tonic as domimant is above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;G - 5th degree (C -&amp;gt; G is a fifth) - dominant (V)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can harmonize notes with chords which have it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">I started taking “Fundamentals of Music Theory “ on Coursera.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharps--flats&quot;&gt;Sharps &amp;amp; flats.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can play major scale starting from any note. When we start from C,
we use only white keys on the piano, but that’s not always the case.
E.g. if we start from G, we use F# (“F sharp” - one semitone sharper
than F). F# can also be denoted as Gb (“G flat”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black piano keys (notes) asymmetry (i.e. the fact that not between
any two white keys there is a black key) creates landmarks for our ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we use notes from some scale, we say that we are in the key of
this scale tonic, e.g. C-maj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scale - ordered sequence of notes.
Key - relationship, feelings, that pull us back to tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we can’t write sharp note on the stave (only white piano keys
are represented). There is a way to define sharps as well. One can
put sharp sign on a note in the stave (in the beginning) and now 
all occurrences of that note have to be sharp. Some selections of
sharps actually represent a valid key. There is a mnemonic to
recognize such keys, called “Circle of fifths”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/600px-Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;circle of fifths&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circle of fifths. Author: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:User:Just_plain_Bill&quot;&gt;Just plain Bill&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg#filelinks&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving by a fifth adds one sharp. Moving by a fourth adds one flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mnemonic for remembering sharps: Father Christmas Gave Dad an Electric
Blanket. For flats: Blanket Explodes And Dad Get Cold Feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample usage - let’s say we see 5 flats. These means that first 5
notes on the left side of the circle (F, B, E, A, D) will be flattened
(and this is key of Db).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we may want to use non sharp or flat note. We can do this 
by using accidentals (inlined signs). These can be sharps or 
flats or a natural (♮, cancels out previous sharps and flats).
Accidentals have their effect to the next vertical bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minor-keys&quot;&gt;Minor keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;related-minor-key&quot;&gt;Related minor key&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each set of sharps or flats defining a major key, actually defines 
related minor key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find a related minor key tonic, you need to take 6th degree
of major scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. D maj = D E F# G A B C# D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B is 6th degree, so it is relative minor for D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can illustrate this visually in the following way. Let’s plot
note frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/1_non_log.svg&quot; alt=&quot;note frequencies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not give us much, since they grow multiplicatively, let’s
do a log plot instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/1_log.svg&quot; alt=&quot;log plot of note frequencies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we see that all notes are uniformly spaced in log space. This
means that in log space, a semitone can be represented via a distance
on the picture. This allows us to represent a major scale as a 
template with holes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/2_log_major.svg&quot; alt=&quot;C maj on log plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be done for Natural Minor and we can see why there is
always a related minor to each major at 6th:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/3_log_minor.svg&quot; alt=&quot;A min with C maj on log plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically when you take 2 major scales together, a natural minor is just
a subset of the resulting notes (on the picture A Natural Minor is
built using notes from C major).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly B natural minor = B C# D E F# G A B - all notes from D maj, just
rearranged (the sequence just starts from B instead of D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-kinds-of-minor-scales&quot;&gt;Other kinds of minor scales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different types of minor scales. We already saw B natural
minor, it still tends into D as a tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B &lt;em&gt;harmonic&lt;/em&gt; minor = B C# D E F# G A# B - A# is 7th degree and it
leads our ear to B being new tonic. You can get harmonic minor by
raising 7th note by semitone in natural minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/3_log_harmonic_minor.svg&quot; alt=&quot;A min harmonic with C maj on log plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know that 1th is called Tonic, 5th - Dominant and now 
we learned that 7th is called “Leading”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In harmonic minor there is 1.5 tone jump (from G to A#) and it can be hard for
people to sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B &lt;em&gt;melodic&lt;/em&gt; minor scale - B C# D E F# G# A# B and backward A G F# E D
C# B. Backward is same as natural minor. To get melodic minor scale
we take natural minor and raise both sixth and seventh notes by a
semitone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/4_log_melodic_minor.svg&quot; alt=&quot;A min melodic with C maj on log plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intervals&quot;&gt;Intervals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define interval by a number and its quality. The number is easy
to get, we just count number of notes on a stave from the lowest
note to the highest (inclusive). As we already know, we can add
sharps and flats to the stave, this won’t affect position of the note,
i.e. the number for the interval will stay the same. In order to 
distinguish such intervals, we define their quality. One cannot 
determine number or quality of an interval just by counting semitones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 5 qualities - Perfect, Diminished, Augmented, Major and
Minor. Unison, fourth, fifth and octave are called perfect and they
can be diminished (semitone smaller) or augmented (semitone larger).
The remaining intervals (second, third, sixth, seventh) can be major
or minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with perfect ones. We say that an interval is perfect
if upper note is in the major key of the lower note. An interval, which is semitone lower
than perfect, is called diminished, if semitone higher - augmented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For seconds, thirds, sixths and seventh - if upper note is in the
key of the lower note, we say that interval is major. Semitone lower - minor, semitone higher - augmented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ledger-lines-and-clefs&quot;&gt;Ledger lines and clefs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can extend the stave using ledger lines, but this becomes hard
to read if you stay there for long time. So there are different
clefs to use the stave in different ranges, e.g. bass, alto and 
tenor. You can combine G clef stave with bass clef stave to get
Grand stave. The both staves “meet” at the first ledger line (i.e.
middle C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Grand stave on log plot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/5_grand_stave_log.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Grand stave on log plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mnemonic for other clefs - the center of the sign is always
placed at middle C (i.e. C4), e.g. tenor clef:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/405px-Tenor_clef_with_ref.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Grand stave on log plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Summary of week 2.

crisis. Obviously, there is a temptation to try to time the market.
Let’s try to estimate the best outcome of timing the market by
considering the 2008 crisis. Perhaps it is not worth it at all
(spoiler: the returns of ideal timing are actually substantial).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-data&quot;&gt;Getting the data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before simulating anything, we need the data. First, I arbitrarily
select the following companies to analyze:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘AAPL’, ‘AMZN’, ‘GOOGL’ - Apple, Amazon and Google, since IT
companies were not that much affected by the crisis from the
operational perspective and if I were &lt;em&gt;hypothetically&lt;/em&gt; timing the market buying them
would seem safer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘BAC’ - Bank of America as an example of a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘WMT’ - Walmart as an example of company which should not be
affected much by the crisis (people still need their groceries).
At least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/04/3-recession-proof-stocks-to-buy-now.aspx&quot;&gt;Motley Fool says so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘^GSPC’ - S&amp;amp;P500 index as a proxy for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘IWRD.AS’ - World index as a proxy for the world. Unfortunately
plenty of world ETFs were created after the crisis, so this is the
only I found with enough data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I just manually downloaded daily prices for these tickers from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/&quot;&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/&lt;/a&gt; (dates: 1st of Jan 2006 - 1st of Jan 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the same data by inserting the ticker in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/&lt;ticker&gt;/history?period1=1136073600&amp;amp;period2=1388534400&amp;amp;interval=1d&amp;amp;filter=history&amp;amp;frequency=1d&lt;/ticker&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then manually clicking “Download Data”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider time period from 3rd of Jan 2006 to 3rd of Jan 2013.
You may be wondering why 3rd and not 1st - because there is no data
for 1st and 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we consider buy&amp;amp;hold outcome, i.e. one buys on 3rd of Jan 2006
and then sells on 3rd of Jan 2013. When buying we take “high” price of
the day and when selling - “low”. This gives us baseline to compare to.
I.e. if one does not time the market, this is their return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, let’s consider an investor who times the market, but only once. In
other words they buy on 3rd of Jan 2006. Then at some point during the
crisis they sell. Then eventually they rebuy. Finally, they sell again
on 3rd of Jan 2013. Let’s enumerate all possibilities to sell and
rebuy and find the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When timing the market, I also take “high” price of
the day for buying and “low” for selling. This gives lower bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;world&quot;&gt;World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold investor’s ROI is -3.5% (bought @ 22.82$ on 2006/01/03, sold @ 22$
on 2013/01/03). Let’s have a look at daily prices during this period:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/IWRD.AS_1_daily_prices.png&quot; alt=&quot;Daily prices for World Index&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the fall has started in 2007 and the recovery in 2009.
It is peculiar to observe how many times it grew during the crisis
and then felt back again. Timing that wouldn’t be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we time the world index once, our ROI becomes whooping 107.26% (sold @
25.6$ on 2007/06/04, bought @ 11.91$ on 2009/03/09). Visually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/IWRD.AS_2_best_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Daily prices for World Index with the best time period for timing
the crisis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red line connects sell and rebuy points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can definitely see that figuring out when to rebuy in practice wouldn’t be
easy at all. There are plenty of small recoveries before the actual
minimum of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now consider all possible scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/IWRD.AS_3_all_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Outcomes of all possible ways to time the market through World Index&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be confusing to read, but please bear with me. Let’s say you
sell in 2007. This corresponds to horizontal line at 2007 (i.e. pick
2007 on the vertical axes). Then let’s say you rebuy in 2012. This
means that you pick 2012 on horizontal axes. Your ROI is the
intersection of the two. I.e. this plot represents all possible ways
to time the market and their outcomes. As we can see, rebuying around
2009 is generally better than others and selling around 2009 was a bad
idea. Also if you misstimed the market, you would reach ~-40% ROI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that I interpolate the missing days  (e.g. holidays) by taking
average of neighbors. This just fills the holes in the graph,
otherwise it is impossible to read (and if you don’t believe me &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/IWRD.AS_3_all_timing
_no_interpolation.png&quot;&gt;here
is an example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, timing the market through World Index in the best case
would be very profitable (one could have 107.26% after 7
years instead of -3.5%). However, it is definitely not easy.
When looking at all possible timing scenarios there is a lot of
blue-purple (which is 0 or negative return). Another problem is that
there are plenty of smaller drops and recoveries during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold investor got 623.74% return (bought @ 10.67$ on 2006/01/03,
sold @ 77.28$ on 2013/01/03).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily prices and best market timing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/AAPL_2_best_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Daily prices for Apple stock with the best time period for timing
the crisis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of growth after the crisis. The best timing scenario
return is 1645.81% (sell @ 28.25 on 2007/12/27, rebuy @ 11.71 on
2009/01/20). In some sense by doing this, one doubles their holdings
and thus boosts the effect of the great growth afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/AAPL_3_all_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Outcomes of all possible ways to time the market through Apple stock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see the “hot” area is much-much smaller than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the drill now, so I will just add the numbers and graphs without
too many words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold: 435.77% return (bought @ 47.84$ on 2006/01/03,
sold @ 256.36$ on 2013/01/03)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/AMZN_2_best_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Daily prices for Amazon stock with the best time period for timing
the crisis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best market timing: 1201.66% (sell @ 94.75$ on 2007/10/09, rebuy @ 39$ on
2008/11/21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/AMZN_3_all_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Outcomes of all possible ways to time the market through Amazon stock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peak returns area is very small now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold: 65.42% return (bought @ 218.05$ on 2006/01/03,
sold @ 360.72$ on 2013/01/03)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/GOOGL_2_best_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Daily prices for Google stock with the best time period for timing
the crisis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best market timing: 345.24% (sell @ 362.86$ on 2007/11/06, rebuy @ 134.81$ on
2008/11/21).&lt;/p&gt;

.png&quot; alt=&quot;Outcomes of all possible ways to time the market through Google stock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am surprised how small buy&amp;amp;hold returns are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bank-of-america&quot;&gt;Bank of America&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold: -74.81% return (bought @ 47.18$ on 2006/01/03,
sold @ 11.88$ on 2013/01/03)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/BAC_2_best_timing

&lt;p&gt;Best market timing: 293.26% (sell @ 54.82$ on 2006/11/17, rebuy @ 3.51$ on
2009/03/05).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/BAC_3_all_timing
.png&quot; alt=&quot;Outcomes of all possible ways to time the market through Google stock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, the buy&amp;amp;hold return is scary and rebuying at 3$ per share is very
peculiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walmart&quot;&gt;Walmart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold: 46.54% return (bought @ 46.66$ on 2006/01/03,
sold @ 68.37$ on 2013/01/03)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/timing_2008/WMT_2_best_timing

&lt;p&gt;This one looks surprisingly easy to time (probably, because the timing
does not bring that much return anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sp500&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P500&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy&amp;amp;hold: 14.58% return (bought @ 1270.21$ on 2006/01/03,

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, timing 2008 well was a very profitable endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-ups&quot;&gt;Follow-ups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now curious to estimate how hard it was to time the market. In 
the follow-up post I want to consider how badly could one time the market
and still make reasonable profit. Also it makes sense to color all timing

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msci.com/developed-markets&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but it has 6% “other”
category. Then one can see a list of all companies in the index with
their weight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msci.com/constituents&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but this does
not help either, since mapping from “company” to “region” is non-
trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is MSCI World ex Europe index. Presumably it is the same as MSCI
World above, but without Europe (at least that’s what name suggests). 80.37% of MSCI World ex Europe is the
US [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/674e5774-727b-
4e85-ad07-1be63cb1d075&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]. For the MSCI World it is 63.81%
[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/149ed7bc-316e-4b4c-8ea4-43fcb5bd6523&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]. Looks like the numbers in the PDFs change with time, so the state above is as of today (the PDFs say “Jan 31, 2020).
Now we can build the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;0.8037 = \frac{\text{US}}{\text{world} - \text{Europe}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s swap numerators and denominators&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{1}{0.8037} = \frac{\text{world} - \text{Europe}}{\text{US}} = \frac{\text{world}}{\text{US}} - \frac{\text{Europe}}{\text{US}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that \(\frac{\text{US}}{\text{world}}\) is 0.6381 (just ratio of the US in MSCI World):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{\text{Europe}}{\text{US}} = \frac{\text{world}}{\text{US}} - \frac{1}{0.8037} = \frac{1}{0.6381} - \frac{1}{0.8037} = 0.3410&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want \(\frac{\text{Europe}}{\text{world}}\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{\text{Europe}}{\text{world}} = \frac{\text{Europe}}{\text{US}} \cdot \frac{\text{US}}{\text{world}} = 0.3410 \cdot 0.6381 = 0.2176&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the ratio of Europe in MSCI World index is 21.8%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sanity-checking&quot;&gt;Sanity checking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at calculating this was actually wrong, so let’s
sanity check. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msci.com/developed-markets&quot;&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt;
says (as of September 2019):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK - 5.47%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;France - 3.8%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switzerland - 3.15%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Germany - 2.86%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Netherlands - 1.33%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Others - 6.27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\( 5.47+3.8+3.15+2.86+1.33 = 16.61 \) - looks plausible!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve had a peculiar puzzle recently.

Coursera&lt;/a&gt; (yeah,
life is unpredictable). Here are my notes for weeks 1&amp;amp;2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always had interest in writing and music and even somewhat intuitive
feel for it. Thus, I would like to actually learn formal stuff and
tools to be able to grow instead of blindly wandering around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually write notes for stuff I learn or read, because this helps
me to structure the information much better and generally improves
recall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-1&quot;&gt;Week 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;point-of-view&quot;&gt;Point of view&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to decide who’s talking to whom and why. There are following
relationships between the singer and audience (perspectives):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;storyteller (third person narrative), “he &amp;amp; she” - the most
objective God-like mode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;first person, “I &amp;amp; she” - the singer tells something about them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;second person, “you &amp;amp; she”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;direct address, “I &amp;amp; you” - the most intimate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no rules in songwriting, only tools. Try different
approaches for your song, e.g. rewrite it from different perspectives
and see which sounds better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;progression--boxes&quot;&gt;Progression &amp;amp; boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your listeners interested. Don’t put everything into the first
verse, create a journey instead. Producer usually creates a music journey
with energy increases &amp;amp; decreases. You use words instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use method of boxes to create the journey. Basically each next
verse incorporates an idea of the previous ones (gains from them), but
also adds something (extends them). The last box is the largest and
brings the most important ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each box can represent different time, e.g. past-present-future and create
a progression in this way. Or perspective can vary, e.g. you-I-we. Or 
times of the year - summer-fall-winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;six-best-friends&quot;&gt;Six best friends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who, what, when, where, why &amp;amp; how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use them to explore inside each box (i.e. you already have a
high level idea and want to develop it further). Each helps to elaborate on
ideas and gives some direction. E.g. when -&amp;gt; spring, summer, morning,
where -&amp;gt; cafe, sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;song-structure&quot;&gt;Song structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boxes are used to develop ideas, the song itself is done via sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;verse - overall story or feel of the song (basic information)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;chorus - central idea (repeated) - the word literally means many
people singing together&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bridge - connects sections&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pre-chorus - little bridge from verse to chorus&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-2&quot;&gt;Week 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prosody&quot;&gt;Prosody&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is actually one rule - prosody - all elements of the song have
to work together to support the central message. Prosody -
an appropriate relationship between elements. This is actually common
sense - why would you put something in your song that does not belong
there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-vs-unstable&quot;&gt;Stable vs unstable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different vehicles to express prosody. E.g. the given unit
of a song (line, section) can be stable or unstable. Stable is like a
fact (“I’m so grateful that you are in my life”), unstable - something
is missing (“I wish you were here”). Just a tone of voice can change
this, e.g. “I finished my song”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often a song combines the two in different sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compositional-elements&quot;&gt;Compositional elements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number of lines&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matched or unmatched line lengths&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rhyme scheme&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rhyme types&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rhythm of lines&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;number-of-lines&quot;&gt;Number of lines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can be used to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;spotlight an important idea (e.g. adding a line when one does not
expect it, this surprises and brings attention to it - see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEzfhclKO8Q&quot;&gt;“The great
pretender”&lt;/a&gt; - “Pretending that you’re still around” is unexpected)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stop motion (even number of lines -&amp;gt; “I’m done”) or move one section into other (odd number of lines
-&amp;gt; “let’s keep going”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;create contrast between sections&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;line-length&quot;&gt;Line length&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same length = stability (balanced, stable, resolved) = “stop”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different length = instability = “let’s keep going, something is missing”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the second line longer than the first one, this create
spotlight for the extended part. If it is shorter, this create longing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.e. line lengths create expectations and one can use this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line length can be used to create contrast between sections. At least
this is much easier than with the number of lines, because that you notice
only when the section is over. E.g. Paul Simon - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABXtWqmArUU&quot;&gt;50 Ways to Leave Your
Lover&lt;/a&gt; - the verse has
long lines, the chorus - very short with quick rhyme, which suggests
that you have to leave your lover fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">I started to take Songwriting course on Coursera (yeah, life is unpredictable).

I was surprised how
many stages this required. Overall this looked like a dark UI
pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is non-obvious how to actually cancel the membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main page looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/1_main_page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Main page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there is “Prime” section, let’s go there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/2_prime_page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prime page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some trial and error I landed at “Update your settings”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/3_update.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Update your settings&amp;quot; dialog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, “End Membership”, now we are talking. It is quite funny that this
entire flow tries to tell me that I will lose all the benefits of
“Prime” membership by canceling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is definitely not the end of the story (probably more
like a middle point). The next screen gets more pushy and tries to
hint me again that I will lose all my “benefits” if I cancel prime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;List of benefits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user is also presented with one bright blue button, which does not
lead to cancellation and two very similar yellow buttons - only one of them
is the correct one. Funny enough it is not the rightmost one. I think
most of the UI teaches the user to click rightmost one. Ok, I increase
my attention level to the maximum and click “I Do Not Want My
Benefits”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Extend your membership?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure the though process was like “oh, looks like this guy
is pretty serious, let’s use heavy artillery… and offer 7 days of
Prime for 0.99 EUR”. WTH? I can’t imagine any use of 7 days of Prime
for 0.99 EUR. Again we see nice blue button, which does not lead to
cancellation and now 3 yellow very similar ones. Only one of
them is the correct button and it is in the middle. At least I am still
able to click it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Really cancel?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another screen. Again two very similar buttons. The upper one is
the correct one. For some reason they changed from horizontal button
layout to vertical. I am pretty sure this just adds confusion and
leads to a few more people clicking the wrong button by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this was the last step (but I already braced myself for more):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/post_resources/canceling_amazon_prime/7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cancellation message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very curious why they stop at 3 screens and not like 10? I find 3
screens already awkward. Perhaps this is just to “protect a poor user
from making a &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; choice” and 10 would be too scammy. Fortunately
they don’t require writing a poem in Chinese about why I want to
cancel and lose “all the wonderful benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy navigation in dark UIs!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I canceled my free Amazon Prime trial recently.

than I expected. Thus, here is my guide, which does not involve any
payed apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you install strings, try to keep the right order of pegs. In
other words adjacent strings should be wired through adjacent pegs.
This will help you a lot during tuning and will prevent any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuning&quot;&gt;Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tune the lower string in each pair as if it is just a normal 6
string guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we start tuning upper strings in each pair starting from the
bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The two lowest are just the same as their paired string.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The remaining 4 should be one octave higher than the other
 string in the pair.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a tuner for 6 string guitar, tuning one octave higher may
be non-trivial. However, you can use a tuner, which shows hertz
measurements. I used an Android app
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta
ils?id=com.bork.dsp.datuna&quot;&gt;DaTuner&lt;/a&gt; for this (I am not associated with this
app in any way and find it quite confusing, but it shows Hz
measurements which was enough for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the final tuning in herz should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(bottom most string) E4 – 329.6 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E4 – 329.6 Hz (same as above)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B3 – 246.9 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B3 – 246.9 Hz (same as above)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G3 – 196 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G4 – 392 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D3 – 146.8 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D4 – 293.7 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A2 – 110 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A3 – 220 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E2 – 82.41 Hz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E3 – 164.81 Hz (one octave higher)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ignore everything except the Hz numbers. Just make sure that
the app shows the given number for the given string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in the Internet suggest to tune the 6th string (i.e. G4) slowly
and letting it to “rest” in the process, since it is so high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the tension is high, so after tuning some strings, the later
strings will detune earlier ones a bit and you can to check them
again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a guitar more or less tuned, you don’t need to use Hz
measurements anymore, since majority of tuners know all the notes and
will show you the distance to the closest note even if it is not one
of 6 string guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy well tuned playing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I recently needed to tune a 12 string guitar and this was less trivial than I expected.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amygdala&quot;&gt;Amygdala&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was already mentioned before, when one has amygdala damage, they
look less into the eyes. In other words, amygdala also “looks” for
signals. Testosterone makes amygdala better at detecting fear and
anger in faces. There is shortcut for visual information to amygdala
(lateral geniculate). This is faster. E.g. cortex can still be
deciding whether it is a 2D or 3D object, but one has already stubbed
other person due to the shortcut (i.e. you trade speed with analytical
accuracy). This pathway is hyper excitable in individuals with post-
traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams syndrome - imprinted genetic disorder. Kids having this
disorder are facile with language and emotions, but cognitively
impaired (IQ approximately 70). They are extremely trustful and, as a
result, vulnerable. They can’t evoke amygdala activation through scary
faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social phobias - any face activates amygdala (i.e. any face is scary).
Under clinical depression, amygdala activates when one observes
something sad, in other words amygdala is contextual (sad is scary,
when you have a depression).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amygdala is also best at dichotomizing - us vs. them and responding to
out-group stimuli. This will be considered in more details later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;frontal-cortex&quot;&gt;Frontal cortex&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible for appropriate behavior. When there is a choice between
doing something easy or hard (but better), frontal cortex makes us to
do the harder thing. It does not apply strong influence, instead it
has many weak and diffused projections. In other words, it gives bias
via slowly “massaging” the signal. This works like modulation. In
other words frontal projections are very diffused and relatively weak,
so they bias towards excitation rather than cause it. Frontal cortex
also has inhibitory projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is “fuel” for this activity. It is not only about
anticipation, but also about driving the behavior needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex also handles gratification postponement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex neurons have high metabolic rates (i.e. work hard), but are also very fragile, which leads to many frontal cortex disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;california-verbal-learning-test&quot;&gt;California Verbal Learning Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a test for dementia - CVLT - California Verbal Learning Test.
A tester tells one: “Today I bought [list of 16 unrelated items]” and
then asks to repeat the items. However, items can be separate into 4
categories, e.g. 4 fruits, 4 hardware etc. The tester repeats the
sentence and one can remember more and more each time. However, one
also begins to group items into categories. E.g. they remember fruits
first and name them and so on. This is executive function - notice
patterns, try to keep track of categories. Frontal cortex handles
this. When there is frontal cortex damage, one remembers items as
usual, but never does the grouping. In other words, frontal cortex
does “I see a pattern, I suspect if I put effort to exploit it, this
will make me more productive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also another test. One sees a circle and then is given time
of the day like “11:10”. They are asked to draw the time as if the
circle is a clock. One draws hours at 11 and then minutes at number
10, because this is the easiest interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another test is to name months backwards. One starts with December,
then November, October, September and then switches to go forward
again, i.e. October, November. They can’t hold off overlearned, more
habitual response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When then they are asked to count from 20 to 1, they do 20, 19, 18,
17, September, October, i.e. slip into the previous task (it intrudes
the next one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-rules&quot;&gt;Learning rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine there is a monkey. They need to pull a lever after seeing a
visual light signal to get food. You see visual system activity
increase during each signal. Frontal cortex gets activated after the
first signal and stays activated - tries to learn the rule from
individual examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point some rule becomes automatic, i.e. it gets stored
somewhere else in the brain. E.g. a demented person may be not able to
tell names of their children, but be able to knit (since they learned
that as a kid). Cerebellum seems to play large role in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-behavior&quot;&gt;Social behavior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same applies to social behavior, e.g. Phineas Cage
[&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;] - foreman at a
railroad construction in 1840s. There was an explosion and a metal rod
went through Cage’s head damaging frontal cortex. It was hot due to
explosion, so it cauterized the blood vessels. Cage was conscious
shortly after the impact. Before the event, he was sober, religious
and highly reliable. After - abusive, sexually predatory, out of
control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays one can study frontal cortex via older people with natural
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25% of men on death row had a history of concussive head trauma to the
front of the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is Mc Naughton rule in the US - if individual can’t tell
difference between right and wrong, they are considered organically
impaired (i.e. this is insanity defense rule). Not seeing a difference
between right and wrong implies e.g. not covering tracks after a
criminal act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. John Hinckley (severe schizophrenic) tried to assassinate Reagan
in 1981. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. However then
Mc Naughton rule got implicitly banned, since people were unhappy that
Hinckley was “getting away”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are people with frontal cortex damage, who can tell the
difference between right and wrong, but can’t control themselves. One
can suggest such a person 5 candies in one hand and 1 in other. When
the person chooses 5, they get the other hand, i.e. 1. They always
choose 5 and get 1. They can even explain you the rule and then choose
5 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chimps fail this test too, but they pass when you give them wooden
pieces to choose from (but reward with candies). I.e. they can control
themselves enough when it is about wood (they don’t care much about
it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For kids there is one classic developmental test with marshmallow. One
gets left in a room with a marshmallow. If they don’t eat it, they
will get 2 instead. This test predicts frontal cortex metabolism as
well as SAT scores many years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little kids have not developed frontal cortex. As a result, when you
play hide and seek with them and ask “where are you?”, they reply
because they can’t stop themselves. Also when they count, they do 7,8,
9, 14, 17 - they can’t inhibit. At age 5 there is a relation between
resting frontal cortex metabolism and socioeconomic status.
Glucocorticoids atrophy neurons here (they have the most receptors
here). I.e. stress of poverty affects size and activity of frontal
cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another example of a mass murdered, who had a massive car
accident when he was 6 years old, which destroyed his frontal cortex.
As a result, in 11 years he committed the first murder. The last crime
was kidnapping a women. After holding her for a week, he just casually
brought her home and left his phone number suggesting to meet again,
since he had a great time with her. He got arrested in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Acquired sociopathy” - one get’s only some part of rules, especially
when getting frontal cortex damage before 5-6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all frontal cortex damage makes a person murderer. They
just can be out of control. E.g. one can be playing piano at a social
gathering for too long, not listening to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 18th century epilepsy was considered a demonic possession. The
person was considered a witch and burned. The legal test was - if they
don’t cry due to a story of crucifixion, they must be a witch. Then
there was a person noting that glands can atrophy, i.e. a person can
be organically impaired and won’t be able to cry at all. Does the same
apply to frontal cortex damage? What should the court do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontal cortex is the last part of the brain to fully develop. On
average it matures around the age of 25. As a result, it is the least
constrained by genes (instead shaped by environment and experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In teenagers - dopamine variation is much stronger (i.e. when adult
has low dopamine, teenager has even lower and otherwise). As a result
there is no death penalty for crimes made between 16 and 18 years,
since the brain is not fully mature yet. However, it is not clear what
exactly happens to one’s brain on their 18th birthday, making death
penalty ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is third most vulnerable region to normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Substantia nigra - motor system (thus, tremor of old age
Parkinson’s)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hippocampus - memory problems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often people believe that older people accept how they are and listen
less to opinion of others because of that, but this is due to frontal
cortex damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resting-metabolism-variations&quot;&gt;Resting metabolism variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with elevated frontal cortex metabolism. Highly regimented,
disciplined, capable of controlling their behavior. Do not express
emotions very readily, bad at reading emotions in other people. They
have extremely structured life. This is due to elevated resting
metabolism in frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrill seekers and sociopaths e.g. have lower levels. For them it
takes more work to regulate (i.e. more frontal cortex gets involved).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relation-to-amygdala&quot;&gt;Relation to amygdala&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amygdala can regulate frontal cortex (both have inhibitory
projections). There is inverse correlation in activity. Without
frontal cortex amygdala can’t learn to stop being afraid. They can
work together e.g. when a harder behavior is scary (e.g. running
towards the enemy in a war).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-parts&quot;&gt;Other parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Septum - inhibits aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lateral hypothalamus - predatory behavior (food acquisition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anterior cingulate - empathy (feeling pain of others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Green did the following test. Imagine you are a group of people
hiding from enemy in a war and you have a crying baby in the group.
Do you kill the baby? People who activate anterior cingulate less are
more likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Green also did runaway trolley problem. You choose between “not
doing anything - 5 people die” and “pull a lever or push a person with
your hands - 1 person dies”. 75% are willing to pull the lever. Only
25% are willing to push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is transmagnetic stimulation which allows to turn parts of
frontal cortex on, this leads to more utilitarian and more selfish
decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract-concepts&quot;&gt;Abstract concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of metaphors in our life, e.g. reputation, plagiarism.
However, we treat abstract concepts like real. E.g. the following
study. One in an elevator. Another person comes with a drink in a cup
and a bunch of books and asks the first person to hold the cup. There
may be a warm or a cold drink there. Afterwards the first person rates
the personality of the second person warmer if the drink was warm.
I.e. we intermix warmth metaphor with actual temperature. In other
words, metaphor storage is based on hijacked pathways for storing
temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see something disgusting (e.g. rotted food), insular cortex
activates. When you hear a story of someone powerful mistreating
someone else (in a really exploitative rotten manner), the same area
also activates. In other words, it handles cases of food being bad,
moral &amp;amp; self disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This even can be seen in the language, e.g. “I am &lt;em&gt;disgusted&lt;/em&gt; by
what you did”. Also “nauseous”, “smells rotten” - i.e. terms intermix
sensory disgust with moral disgust. I.e. moral disgust is shoehorned
in this part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People thinking of their moral failings are more likely to choose soap
as a reward afterwards to “wash their hands of their sins” (study).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one is allowed to wash their hands of their metaphorical sins, they
are less likely to help the other person who dropped books (study).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how mammalian brain does abstract thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Haidt did the following study. Ask people about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;siblings having non-reproductive sexual relationship in private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grandma asks to slap her&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;burn flag and step on it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eat your dead pet (when you are extremely hungry)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these activate insular cortex, people can’t explain what’s
wrong. I.e. cognitive decisions catch up afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are areas which activate in various contexts, e.g. for murder or
orgasm it can be increases heart rate (i.e. non-specificity of
arousal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elli Wiesel said that opposite of love is not hate, but indifference.
Love and hate are physiologically similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testosterone&quot;&gt;Testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testosterone (like in sexual behavior) is required for expressions of
aggression. The more prior experience one has, the more residual
behavior they have when testosterone is removed. Behavior drives
testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. take a rhesus monkey. They build dominance hierarchy. Pump rank 3
out of 5 with testosterone. They start beating 4 and 5 more. I.e.
testosterone only exaggerates existing social structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When testosterone is higher, amygdala threshold for a threatening face
is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testosterone shortens refractory period of single neurons in amygdala.
I.e. it does not cause anything, it only amplifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hyenas&quot;&gt;Hyenas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spotted hyenas - females dominate males. They are bigger, more
muscular, more aggressive, have more testosterone, androgenization.
Clitoris has size of male penises. They are hormonally more male than
males are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most lions starve to death in the first year of life, because the
order to eat is males, females, cubs. In hyenas it is cubs, females,
males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In primates, when one tries to dominate they get an erection. In
hyenas males get erections when they are terrified (this is
subordinate gesture). Low ranking females also get clitoral erections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecturer told a story about his friend getting invited to a
conference on predatory behavior organized by the military. The
explanation was that they wanted to teach tank corps to hunt like
carnivores (in a good tank). The exact reason is not known.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Course reviews&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Aggression - part 2.</summary></entry></feed>
