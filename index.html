            Diversifying over ETF providers
          </a>
        </h3><p>Many people talk about diversification in terms of geographic areas or economy sectors.
However, the diversification does not stop there. One can also diversify over brokers
where the shares are held. This way if something happens to one broker or the account gets hacked,
not everything is lost. Another dimension is over ETF providers.
This decreases impact of forced capital gain tax realizations. Let’s see how and why.</p>

            Value does not have to be perfect
          </a>
        </h3><p>I am interested in startups and try to pay attention to how exactly value is created around me.
I am also somewhat a perfectionist and when I try to create value myself, I tend to over-polish 
the details, often not being even sure whether the value is actually created. I noticed a couple examples
of projects with imperfections (sometimes major), which people use anyway. Let’s look at these examples more.</p>

        </h3><p>It is very easy to advice others to do something, but it is very hard to be sure that this will actually help them.
However, not all understand this or choose to phrase their advice accordingly. I.e. instead of “here is a way to X”,
it actually should be “this is how I did X”. Thus, very often non-objective advice is just a description of what helped
the author, which is also true for some of my posts.</p>

            How technology affects our lives - a story about a delayed sms
          </a>
        </h3><p>Today I stumbled upon a tweet about an SMS which was sent before Valentine’s day, but was delivered only recently
(i.e. 9 months later). This made me think about the impact of technology on our lives. Let’s look more into what 
has happened and my thoughts as well as speculations about the reasons for such a delay.</p>

catching all ideas like that. Let’s see why you might discover a lot of new about
yourself this way.</p>

            Should you tell others about FIRE?
          </a>
        </h3><p>Participating in Financial Independence / Early Retirement (aka FIRE) movement can become
a substantial part of one’s life or even identity. At the same time the number of 
people in the movement is still small and, thus, most of the time we talk to
people who have no clue whatsoever about FIRE. As a result, one wonders quite often
whether they should share their FIRE story and explain the concept.
Let’s see arguments for and against.</p>

            No one promised you anything in life
          </a>
        </h3><p>Quite often I observe people being unhappy about their life as if someone has promised them
something. Somehow they focus on what could/should have been better in their life and this
makes them extremely unhappy. At the same time, from my perspective they are not doing that bad.
They are just too much into their fantasies instead of appreciating what they have.
Let’s look into into “no one has promised anything” and see some examples.</p>

        </h3><p>Quite some time ago I stumbled upon <a href="https://twitter.com/akirathedon/status/1152459994849091584">a tweet</a>
just saying “get in the zone, then refuse to leave”.
Despite the simplicity of the advice and complete absence of any proof, this has
a profound positive effect on my productivity. Let’s see what this means for me
and why I think this works so well.</p>

            Future proofness
          </a>
        </h3><p>Long time ago I learned about a concept, which I now call “future proofness”.
I coined this term myself, but it is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_proof">present</a> in Wikipedia.
However, with a bit different meaning. In my case, the main idea was that the future
technology could improve and extract additional information from your current artifacts.
Let’s see couple examples.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>MVV (Munich public transport company) changes their pricing structure on 15.12.2019.
The old (current) system can be at times extremely confusing (e.g. mixing up
rings and zones when buying weekly tickets). Let’s see what has changed in the 
new system (mostly focusing on the inner city).</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>I happened to read "Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now" by Gordon Livingston.
While the title sounds extremely fishy (I suppose that this “X things blablabla” is used a lot by cheap article
websites with low quality content), the book itself was overall surprisingly good.</p>

unimportant areas to be able to reach something reasonable in more important areas).
However, how to understand what to drop was not that clear.</p>

        </h3><p>Quite a peculiar story happened to me recently.
I was buying a FlixBus ticket for 24.99 EUR. I already had it in my “cart” and I had 
30 minutes to buy it before the cart expires. Then I started double checking other
details and in the end it expired (actually couple seconds before I pressed “pay”).
I tried to buy it again, but now the price was 29.99 EUR, i.e. 5 EUR more.</p>

explain treating themselves something nice. The expressions itself often comes from

Financial Independence / Early Retirement, I can see that one’s employer
can be incentivized in one following this expression. Let’s see how.</p>

        </h3><p>Financial Independence / Early Retirement is about reaching a state, in which you get enough passive income to live.
Let’s say you get \(Y\) EUR each month. The overall money you get over time is \( M = Y * t \), where \(t\) is time.
This resembles a physics equation for movement with constant speed (i.e. no acceleration).
Let’s explore this similarity and try to add acceleration to FIRE and get FIRE\(^2\) (FIRE squared, I just made this
name up).</p>
