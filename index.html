            How to disable notifications prompt in Chrome?

        </h3><p>Numerous sites ask for permission “to show notifications”.
Some of them even obstruct the site itself unless ones makes a choice in this permission prompt.
Pressing “no” multiple times a day (with a probability to eventually misclick “yes”)
sounds like wasting of time. Fortunately, there is a way in Chrome
to say “no” by default (i.e. disable this prompts completely and never see them again).</p>

didn’t get enough out of the workshops (they are surprisingly crowded). Thus, I will try to practice in much smaller
groups (like 2 people). This can be challenging since majority of games are for more people. Here is my compilation

            A peculiar story about DHL, UTF-8 and Skype
          </a>
        </h3><p>Recently I needed to send a parcel and I decided to use DHL and pay online.
Unfortunately the form always showed me an obscure error. I tried to debug it. In the end I managed to find out the precise cause of the error and it happened to be related to UTF-8 encoding and Skype.</p>

            Frugal travel or how much does FIWE 2019 cost

        </h3><p>I’ve accidentally discovered that there will be another <a href="https://whatlifecouldbe.eu/fiwe/fiwe-2019/">Financial Independence Week Europe (2019)</a> in Budapest in May. 
I felt like it might be interesting to go there. However, before committing, I definitely should know how much it will cost,
since my willingness to go is a function of cost. For example, with <a href="https://www.fichautauqua.com/">Chautauqua 2019</a> everything is extremely simple - 
€2300 is just too much.</p>

<p>So let’s see how much FIWE 2019 actually costs (at least for me) and consider some frugal (aka cheap) ways of attending.</p>

        </h3><p>Often I hear people invoking “my time costs X” argument when discussing ways to save money. Usually that’s how they explain why it does not make sense to spend time to save some amount Y, especially when it is much smaller than what they earn (i.e. X).</p>

<p>They are likely wrong. Let’s see why.</p>
