    <p>Aggression - part 2.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="amygdala">Amygdala</h2>

<p>As it was already mentioned before, when one has amygdala damage, they
look less into the eyes. In other words, amygdala also “looks” for
signals. Testosterone makes amygdala better at detecting fear and
anger in faces. There is shortcut for visual information to amygdala
(lateral geniculate). This is faster. E.g. cortex can still be
deciding whether it is a 2D or 3D object, but one has already stubbed
other person due to the shortcut (i.e. you trade speed with analytical
accuracy). This pathway is hyper excitable in individuals with post-
traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<p>Williams syndrome - imprinted genetic disorder. Kids having this
disorder are facile with language and emotions, but cognitively
impaired (IQ approximately 70). They are extremely trustful and, as a
result, vulnerable. They can’t evoke amygdala activation through scary
faces.</p>

<p>Social phobias - any face activates amygdala (i.e. any face is scary).
Under clinical depression, amygdala activates when one observes
something sad, in other words amygdala is contextual (sad is scary,
when you have a depression).</p>

<p>Amygdala is also best at dichotomizing - us vs. them and responding to
out-group stimuli. This will be considered in more details later.</p>

<h2 id="frontal-cortex">Frontal cortex</h2>

<p>Responsible for appropriate behavior. When there is a choice between
doing something easy or hard (but better), frontal cortex makes us to
do the harder thing. It does not apply strong influence, instead it
has many weak and diffused projections. In other words, it gives bias
via slowly “massaging” the signal. This works like modulation. In
other words frontal projections are very diffused and relatively weak,
so they bias towards excitation rather than cause it. Frontal cortex
also has inhibitory projections.</p>

<p>Dopamine is “fuel” for this activity. It is not only about
anticipation, but also about driving the behavior needed.</p>

<p>Frontal cortex also handles gratification postponement.</p>

<p>Frontal cortex neurons have high metabolic rates (i.e. work hard), but are also very fragile, which leads to many frontal cortex disorders.</p>

<h3 id="california-verbal-learning-test">California Verbal Learning Test</h3>

<p>There is a test for dementia - CVLT - California Verbal Learning Test.
A tester tells one: “Today I bought [list of 16 unrelated items]” and
then asks to repeat the items. However, items can be separate into 4
categories, e.g. 4 fruits, 4 hardware etc. The tester repeats the
sentence and one can remember more and more each time. However, one
also begins to group items into categories. E.g. they remember fruits
first and name them and so on. This is executive function - notice
patterns, try to keep track of categories. Frontal cortex handles
this. When there is frontal cortex damage, one remembers items as
usual, but never does the grouping. In other words, frontal cortex
does “I see a pattern, I suspect if I put effort to exploit it, this
will make me more productive”.</p>

<p>There is also another test. One sees a circle and then is given time
of the day like “11:10”. They are asked to draw the time as if the
circle is a clock. One draws hours at 11 and then minutes at number
10, because this is the easiest interpretation.</p>

<p>Another test is to name months backwards. One starts with December,
then November, October, September and then switches to go forward
again, i.e. October, November. They can’t hold off overlearned, more
habitual response.</p>

<p>When then they are asked to count from 20 to 1, they do 20, 19, 18,
17, September, October, i.e. slip into the previous task (it intrudes
the next one).</p>

<h3 id="learning-rules">Learning rules</h3>

<p>Imagine there is a monkey. They need to pull a lever after seeing a
visual light signal to get food. You see visual system activity
increase during each signal. Frontal cortex gets activated after the
first signal and stays activated - tries to learn the rule from
individual examples.</p>

<p>At some point some rule becomes automatic, i.e. it gets stored
somewhere else in the brain. E.g. a demented person may be not able to
tell names of their children, but be able to knit (since they learned
that as a kid). Cerebellum seems to play large role in this.</p>

<h3 id="social-behavior">Social behavior</h3>

<p>Same applies to social behavior, e.g. Phineas Cage
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">wiki</a>] - foreman at a
railroad construction in 1840s. There was an explosion and a metal rod
went through Cage’s head damaging frontal cortex. It was hot due to
explosion, so it cauterized the blood vessels. Cage was conscious
shortly after the impact. Before the event, he was sober, religious
and highly reliable. After - abusive, sexually predatory, out of
control.</p>

<p>Nowadays one can study frontal cortex via older people with natural
damage.</p>

<p>25% of men on death row had a history of concussive head trauma to the
front of the head.</p>

<p>There is Mc Naughton rule in the US - if individual can’t tell
difference between right and wrong, they are considered organically
impaired (i.e. this is insanity defense rule). Not seeing a difference
between right and wrong implies e.g. not covering tracks after a
criminal act.</p>

<p>E.g. John Hinckley (severe schizophrenic) tried to assassinate Reagan
in 1981. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. However then
Mc Naughton rule got implicitly banned, since people were unhappy that
Hinckley was “getting away”.</p>

<p>However, there are people with frontal cortex damage, who can tell the
difference between right and wrong, but can’t control themselves. One
can suggest such a person 5 candies in one hand and 1 in other. When
the person chooses 5, they get the other hand, i.e. 1. They always
choose 5 and get 1. They can even explain you the rule and then choose
5 anyway.</p>

<p>Chimps fail this test too, but they pass when you give them wooden
pieces to choose from (but reward with candies). I.e. they can control
themselves enough when it is about wood (they don’t care much about
it).</p>

<p>For kids there is one classic developmental test with marshmallow. One
gets left in a room with a marshmallow. If they don’t eat it, they
will get 2 instead. This test predicts frontal cortex metabolism as
well as SAT scores many years later.</p>

<p>Little kids have not developed frontal cortex. As a result, when you
play hide and seek with them and ask “where are you?”, they reply
because they can’t stop themselves. Also when they count, they do 7,8,
9, 14, 17 - they can’t inhibit. At age 5 there is a relation between
resting frontal cortex metabolism and socioeconomic status.
Glucocorticoids atrophy neurons here (they have the most receptors
here). I.e. stress of poverty affects size and activity of frontal
cortex.</p>

<p>There was another example of a mass murdered, who had a massive car
accident when he was 6 years old, which destroyed his frontal cortex.
As a result, in 11 years he committed the first murder. The last crime
was kidnapping a women. After holding her for a week, he just casually
brought her home and left his phone number suggesting to meet again,
since he had a great time with her. He got arrested in an hour.</p>

<p>“Acquired sociopathy” - one get’s only some part of rules, especially
when getting frontal cortex damage before 5-6 years of age.</p>

<p>However, not all frontal cortex damage makes a person murderer. They
just can be out of control. E.g. one can be playing piano at a social
gathering for too long, not listening to anyone.</p>

<p>In 18th century epilepsy was considered a demonic possession. The
person was considered a witch and burned. The legal test was - if they
don’t cry due to a story of crucifixion, they must be a witch. Then
there was a person noting that glands can atrophy, i.e. a person can
be organically impaired and won’t be able to cry at all. Does the same
apply to frontal cortex damage? What should the court do?</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>

<p>Frontal cortex is the last part of the brain to fully develop. On
average it matures around the age of 25. As a result, it is the least
constrained by genes (instead shaped by environment and experience).</p>

<p>In teenagers - dopamine variation is much stronger (i.e. when adult
has low dopamine, teenager has even lower and otherwise). As a result
there is no death penalty for crimes made between 16 and 18 years,
since the brain is not fully mature yet. However, it is not clear what
exactly happens to one’s brain on their 18th birthday, making death
penalty ok.</p>

<p>This is third most vulnerable region to normal aging.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Substantia nigra - motor system (thus, tremor of old age
Parkinson’s)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hippocampus - memory problems</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Often people believe that older people accept how they are and listen
less to opinion of others because of that, but this is due to frontal
cortex damage.</p>

<h3 id="resting-metabolism-variations">Resting metabolism variations</h3>

<p>People with elevated frontal cortex metabolism. Highly regimented,
disciplined, capable of controlling their behavior. Do not express
emotions very readily, bad at reading emotions in other people. They
have extremely structured life. This is due to elevated resting
metabolism in frontal cortex.</p>

<p>Thrill seekers and sociopaths e.g. have lower levels. For them it
takes more work to regulate (i.e. more frontal cortex gets involved).</p>

<h3 id="relation-to-amygdala">Relation to amygdala</h3>

<p>Amygdala can regulate frontal cortex (both have inhibitory
projections). There is inverse correlation in activity. Without
frontal cortex amygdala can’t learn to stop being afraid. They can
work together e.g. when a harder behavior is scary (e.g. running
towards the enemy in a war).</p>

<h2 id="other-parts">Other parts</h2>

<p>Septum - inhibits aggression.</p>

<p>Lateral hypothalamus - predatory behavior (food acquisition).</p>

<p>Anterior cingulate - empathy (feeling pain of others).</p>

<p>Josh Green did the following test. Imagine you are a group of people
hiding from enemy in a war and you have a crying baby in the group.
Do you kill the baby? People who activate anterior cingulate less are
more likely to do so.</p>

<p>Josh Green also did runaway trolley problem. You choose between “not
doing anything - 5 people die” and “pull a lever or push a person with
your hands - 1 person dies”. 75% are willing to pull the lever. Only
25% are willing to push.</p>

<p>There is transmagnetic stimulation which allows to turn parts of
frontal cortex on, this leads to more utilitarian and more selfish
decision making.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-concepts">Abstract concepts</h2>

<p>We have a lot of metaphors in our life, e.g. reputation, plagiarism.
However, we treat abstract concepts like real. E.g. the following
study. One in an elevator. Another person comes with a drink in a cup
and a bunch of books and asks the first person to hold the cup. There
may be a warm or a cold drink there. Afterwards the first person rates
the personality of the second person warmer if the drink was warm.
I.e. we intermix warmth metaphor with actual temperature. In other
words, metaphor storage is based on hijacked pathways for storing
temperature.</p>

<p>When you see something disgusting (e.g. rotted food), insular cortex
activates. When you hear a story of someone powerful mistreating
someone else (in a really exploitative rotten manner), the same area
also activates. In other words, it handles cases of food being bad,
moral &amp; self disgust.</p>

<p>This even can be seen in the language, e.g. “I am <em>disgusted</em> by
what you did”. Also “nauseous”, “smells rotten” - i.e. terms intermix
sensory disgust with moral disgust. I.e. moral disgust is shoehorned
in this part of the brain.</p>

<p>People thinking of their moral failings are more likely to choose soap
as a reward afterwards to “wash their hands of their sins” (study).</p>

<p>If one is allowed to wash their hands of their metaphorical sins, they
are less likely to help the other person who dropped books (study).</p>

<p>That’s how mammalian brain does abstract thinking.</p>

<p>Jonathan Haidt did the following study. Ask people about</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>siblings having non-reproductive sexual relationship in private.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grandma asks to slap her</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>burn flag and step on it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>eat your dead pet (when you are extremely hungry)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these activate insular cortex, people can’t explain what’s
wrong. I.e. cognitive decisions catch up afterwards.</p>

<p>There are areas which activate in various contexts, e.g. for murder or
orgasm it can be increases heart rate (i.e. non-specificity of
arousal).</p>

<p>Elli Wiesel said that opposite of love is not hate, but indifference.
Love and hate are physiologically similar.</p>

<h2 id="testosterone">Testosterone</h2>

<p>Testosterone (like in sexual behavior) is required for expressions of
aggression. The more prior experience one has, the more residual
behavior they have when testosterone is removed. Behavior drives
testosterone.</p>

<p>E.g. take a rhesus monkey. They build dominance hierarchy. Pump rank 3
out of 5 with testosterone. They start beating 4 and 5 more. I.e.
testosterone only exaggerates existing social structure.</p>

<p>When testosterone is higher, amygdala threshold for a threatening face
is lower.</p>

<p>Testosterone shortens refractory period of single neurons in amygdala.
I.e. it does not cause anything, it only amplifies.</p>

<h3 id="hyenas">Hyenas</h3>

<p>In spotted hyenas - females dominate males. They are bigger, more
muscular, more aggressive, have more testosterone, androgenization.
Clitoris has size of male penises. They are hormonally more male than
males are.</p>

<p>Most lions starve to death in the first year of life, because the
order to eat is males, females, cubs. In hyenas it is cubs, females,
males.</p>

<p>In primates, when one tries to dominate they get an erection. In
hyenas males get erections when they are terrified (this is
subordinate gesture). Low ranking females also get clitoral erections.</p>

<p>The lecturer told a story about his friend getting invited to a
conference on predatory behavior organized by the military. The
explanation was that they wanted to teach tank corps to hunt like
carnivores (in a good tank). The exact reason is not known.</p>
