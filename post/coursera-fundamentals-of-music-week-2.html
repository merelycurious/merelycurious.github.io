    <p>Summary of week 2. Sharps, flats, keys, intervals, other clefs.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="sharps--flats">Sharps &amp; flats.</h2>

<p>We can play major scale starting from any note. When we start from C,
we use only white keys on the piano, but that’s not always the case.
E.g. if we start from G, we use F# (“F sharp” - one semitone sharper
than F). F# can also be denoted as Gb (“G flat”).</p>

<p>Black piano keys (notes) asymmetry (i.e. the fact that not between
any two white keys there is a black key) creates landmarks for our ears.</p>

<h2 id="key">Key</h2>

<p>If we use notes from some scale, we say that we are in the key of
this scale tonic, e.g. C-maj.</p>

<p>Scale - ordered sequence of notes.
Key - relationship, feelings, that pull us back to tonic.</p>

<p>So far we can’t write sharp note on the stave (only white piano keys
are represented). There is a way to define sharps as well. One can
put sharp sign on a note in the stave (in the beginning) and now 
all occurrences of that note have to be sharp. Some selections of
sharps actually represent a valid key. There is a mnemonic to
recognize such keys, called “Circle of fifths”:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/600px-Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg.png" alt="circle of fifths" /></p>

<p><em>Circle of fifths. Author: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:User:Just_plain_Bill">Just plain Bill</a>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg#filelinks">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<p>Moving by a fifth adds one sharp. Moving by a fourth adds one flat.</p>

<p>Mnemonic for remembering sharps: Father Christmas Gave Dad an Electric
Blanket. For flats: Blanket Explodes And Dad Get Cold Feet.</p>

<p>Sample usage - let’s say we see 5 flats. These means that first 5
notes on the left side of the circle (F, B, E, A, D) will be flattened
(and this is key of Db).</p>

<p>However, we may want to use non sharp or flat note. We can do this 
by using accidentals (inlined signs). These can be sharps or 
flats or a natural (♮, cancels out previous sharps and flats).
Accidentals have their effect to the next vertical bar.</p>

<h3 id="minor-keys">Minor keys</h3>

<h4 id="related-minor-key">Related minor key</h4>

<p>Each set of sharps or flats defining a major key, actually defines 
related minor key.</p>

<p>To find a related minor key tonic, you need to take 6th degree
of major scale.</p>

<p>E.g. D maj = D E F# G A B C# D</p>

<p>B is 6th degree, so it is relative minor for D.</p>

<p>We can illustrate this visually in the following way. Let’s plot
note frequencies:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/1_non_log.svg" alt="note frequencies" /></p>

<p>This does not give us much, since they grow multiplicatively, let’s
do a log plot instead:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/1_log.svg" alt="log plot of note frequencies" /></p>

<p>Now we see that all notes are uniformly spaced in log space. This
means that in log space, a semitone can be represented via a distance
on the picture. This allows us to represent a major scale as a 
template with holes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/2_log_major.svg" alt="C maj on log plot" /></p>

<p>The same can be done for Natural Minor and we can see why there is
always a related minor to each major at 6th:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/3_log_minor.svg" alt="A min with C maj on log plot" /></p>

<p>Basically when you take 2 major scales together, a natural minor is just
a subset of the resulting notes (on the picture A Natural Minor is
built using notes from C major).</p>

<p>Similarly B natural minor = B C# D E F# G A B - all notes from D maj, just
rearranged (the sequence just starts from B instead of D).</p>

<h4 id="other-kinds-of-minor-scales">Other kinds of minor scales</h4>

<p>There are different types of minor scales. We already saw B natural
minor, it still tends into D as a tonic.</p>

<p>B <em>harmonic</em> minor = B C# D E F# G A# B - A# is 7th degree and it
leads our ear to B being new tonic. You can get harmonic minor by
raising 7th note by semitone in natural minor.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/3_log_harmonic_minor.svg" alt="A min harmonic with C maj on log plot" /></p>

<p>We already know that 1th is called Tonic, 5th - Dominant and now 
we learned that 7th is called “Leading”.</p>

<p>In harmonic minor there is 1.5 tone jump (from G to A#) and it can be hard for
people to sing.</p>

<p>B <em>melodic</em> minor scale - B C# D E F# G# A# B and backward A G F# E D
C# B. Backward is same as natural minor. To get melodic minor scale
we take natural minor and raise both sixth and seventh notes by a
semitone.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/4_log_melodic_minor.svg" alt="A min melodic with C maj on log plot" /></p>

<h2 id="intervals">Intervals</h2>

<p>You define interval by a number and its quality. The number is easy
to get, we just count number of notes on a stave from the lowest
note to the highest (inclusive). As we already know, we can add
sharps and flats to the stave, this won’t affect position of the note,
i.e. the number for the interval will stay the same. In order to 
distinguish such intervals, we define their quality. One cannot 
determine number or quality of an interval just by counting semitones.</p>

<p>There are 5 qualities - Perfect, Diminished, Augmented, Major and
Minor. Unison, fourth, fifth and octave are called perfect and they
can be diminished (semitone smaller) or augmented (semitone larger).
The remaining intervals (second, third, sixth, seventh) can be major
or minor.</p>

<p>Let’s start with perfect ones. We say that an interval is perfect
if upper note is in the major key of the lower note. An interval, which is semitone lower
than perfect, is called diminished, if semitone higher - augmented.</p>

<p>For seconds, thirds, sixths and seventh - if upper note is in the
key of the lower note, we say that interval is major. Semitone lower - minor, semitone higher - augmented</p>

<h2 id="ledger-lines-and-clefs">Ledger lines and clefs</h2>

<p>We can extend the stave using ledger lines, but this becomes hard
to read if you stay there for long time. So there are different
clefs to use the stave in different ranges, e.g. bass, alto and 
tenor. You can combine G clef stave with bass clef stave to get
Grand stave. The both staves “meet” at the first ledger line (i.e.
middle C).</p>

<p>Here is Grand stave on log plot:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/5_grand_stave_log.svg" alt="Grand stave on log plot" /></p>

<p>As a mnemonic for other clefs - the center of the sign is always
placed at middle C (i.e. C4), e.g. tenor clef:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_resources/coursera_fundamentals_of_music_week_2/405px-Tenor_clef_with_ref.svg.png" alt="Grand stave on log plot" /></p>
