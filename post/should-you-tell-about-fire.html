    <p>Participating in Financial Independence / Early Retirement (aka FIRE) movement can become
a substantial part of one’s life or even identity. At the same time the number of 
people in the movement is still small and, thus, most of the time we talk to
people who have no clue whatsoever about FIRE. As a result, one wonders quite often
whether they should share their FIRE story and explain the concept.
Let’s see arguments for and against.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>

<p>Before we start - a little disclaimer. The life is very complex and multidimensional
and obviously the precise answer whether to share FIRE concept depends on a lot of factors
especially on the person who you consider sharing to. Thus, treat this as food for
thought and consider each situation on case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2 id="i-have-a-lot-of-money">“I have a lot of money”</h2>

<p>Reaching FIRE requires a substantial amount of money, which people outside of FIRE usually don’t
have. Even if you don’t tell this explicitly, a person can easily
deduce this fact from the concept itself. Basically, FIRE = “save a lot” and when
you say “I am into FIRE”, the other person can easily conclude that you want
to have a lot of money and you are on your way there.</p>

<p>Publicly announcing having a lot of money can backfire. In the worst case the question
can be even about physical safety (highly depends on a country and the setup). In mild cases
this may give a wrong incentive to the other person. E.g. “oh, this person has a lot of
money, I should hang out with them, perhaps they are generous”. I.e. they could start liking
your money more than you and it may be tricky to distinguish the two.</p>

<p>This is especially tricky in relationships. In many countries there are implicit 
assumptions that one party has to contribute more financially. If this person happens
to be into FIRE and their partner - not, this may sound like a jackpot for the non-FIRE partner.
Basically, from their perspective it is like “hey, I don’t plan to work and since I am considering spending my life with
you, you probably won’t need to work either”. Even when one does not have such dramatic
malicious incentives, they can still be appealed by your financial security and stability.
Again this does not sound right - one should like the person, not their financial state.
At the same time it is perfectly rational for them. If they want a good life for themselves
and their kids, having a very financially stable partner is the best. Thus, I do 
definitely understand their perspective.</p>

<p>Here we can conclude that you should not tell that you are into FIRE to
people who you know poorly to avoid becoming a fruitful target for scams.
If you are in a relationship, consider delaying telling this too.
The idea is to be sure that your partner would be with you even
if you were not into FIRE.</p>

<h2 id="trust">Trust</h2>

<p>At the same time, I think that you have to eventually tell your partner
everything. First, otherwise it will be extremely hard to explain your 
lifestyle (I can’t even imagine any plausible attempt at this). Second,
if you can’t tell this, then you just don’t have enough trust and 
this suggests that the relationship has intrinsic problems. Obviously,
your case can differ.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that trust begets trust (which I read
from “Search Inside Yourself” book, <a href="/post/book-summary-search-inside-yourself">here</a>
is my summary). Thus, by sharing
such an intricate and important detail of your life, you can improve
the state of the relationship and create a positive feedback loop of trust.</p>

<p>From this perspective you should eventually tell about FIRE
people close to you and who you reasonably now and trust. Especially
in a relationship.</p>

<h2 id="unhealthy-reference-point">Unhealthy reference point</h2>

<p>Oh, I started to use this concept of reference points for happiness quite
a lot recently. I discovered it in “The Science of Wellbeing” course
(<a href="/post/the-science-of-wellbeing-course-review">my summary</a>),
I also recommend to take the course, it is life changing). The idea is that
people are bad at absolute evaluations, so they compare relatively,
e.g. when they decide how good their life is. As a result, when they happen
to have unfortunately high basis for comparison (e.g. rich friend or
neighbor or even some movie actor), they become unnecessarily unhappy.</p>

<p>I get the same impression about FIRE. On the one hand, it can be
like a blessing in life. The move from blind
consumerism and working until state pension to having a concrete goal
and plan can improve one’s life greatly. On the other hand, it can
be a curse. For some people it can be very hard to rich FIRE
for various reasons. They could be okeyish with their current state.
E.g. they just have accepted it and got used to it. And then you
tell them that there is this way to not work and live happily and so on.
This can revive their inner struggle about their state. This can also
set unhealthy reference point for them: “Hey, my friend can reach that,
so I should be able too”. As a result, just knowing about FIRE existence
can make them unhappy.</p>

<p>It is also peculiar that reaching FIRE can actually be demanding in many ways.
One has actually to learn a lot, to control themselves, to manage their
finances, to plan everything for many years in the future. All of these
can be tricky. One can also easily become an outlier and lose their friends
and even their partner if they happen to disagree with the FIRE lifestyle.
Thus, by sharing the idea of FIRE, you may in some way force the other person
into all these difficulties.</p>

<p>At the same time we are all grownups and theoretically should be able to make
our own decisions. Having one more option in life, one more theoretical way to move forward,
shouldn’t hurt that much. In the worst case, we can just drop the idea.
I think our brains are good at coming up with not always rational reasons to explain
whatever we want (this was mentioned during the “Science of Wellbeing” course too).</p>

<p>I personally learned about FIRE by chance and extremely happy about it.
Not sure how I would feel about someone else convincing me. I would probably
assume that it is some Ponzi scheme or other scam.</p>

<p>Thus, from this perspective, you may try to see how useful the idea of FIRE
will be for someone. If they will likely pursue it and be able to achieve
it, it should be ok to share. If they will just drop it as nonsense, this is 
fine too. If they are likely to get stuck in the middle - the idea is reasonable,
but not achievable - consider not sharing.</p>

<p>I personally would rather not share and not “convert” people.
It is also partly due to reasons above - by sharing the concept
I will also tell others that I am into FIRE, which I prefer not to do.</p>

<h2 id="meetups">Meetups</h2>

<p>Fortunately there are FIRE oriented meetups, where everyone already knows the concept
and is in approximately similar situation. Thus, if you want to discuss FIRE
(e.g. roast your plan), you should consider attending something like this.
I did this couple times and it was very refreshing experience after years of
silence regarding FIRE.</p>

<p>Happy FIRE discussions (or silence)!</p>
