    <p>Human Sexual Behavior - part 3 &amp; Aggression - part 1.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>There is female-female competition in pair bonding species, since male
takes care of the kids (if he believes that he is the father). A
female wants a male, who is good at this.</p>

<p>There are species (e.g. New World monkeys) where females are more
aggressive than males and have larger bodies. I.e. exactly opposite to
the majority of species.</p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-homosexuality">Evolution of homosexuality</h2>

<p>The estimated homosexuality rate is from 5% to 20% (across all human 
cultures).</p>

<p>There are 3 theories (all based on the assumption of genetic component
of sexual orientation):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>heterozygotic-vigor argument</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gender dependent genetic argument - sisters of gay men have higher
than average reproductive rate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helper at the nest - homosexual individuals spend resources on
helping their siblings and, thus, pass their genes indirectly. In
other words both sisters and brothers of homosexual siblings should
have increased reproductive rates (this has been observed).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="looking-good">Looking good</h2>

<h3 id="facial-symmetry">Facial symmetry</h3>

<p>In 19th century there was a theory of “criminal face”. They overlapped
faces of criminals and produced a composite face. Everyone perceived
this face as very good looking. When you average faces, they look more
attractive than the individuals they came from. The more faces there
are in the composite, the more attractive it is perceived.</p>

<p>The explanation - you get highly symmetrical face. Symmetry is a good
reliable marker of health. Wildly asymmetrical faces are typically
results of developmental issues.</p>

<p>People can pick up astonishingly subtle asymmetries in faces. Two
months old babies already prefer to look at pictures of more
symmetrical faces. This is also observed in other species.</p>

<p>There was a study, which has shown that people with more symmetrical
faces are better dancers. They recorded people dancing and removed all
features of a person (e.g. replaced with a 3D model). Other people
rated the resulting dances. Dances of people with more symmetrical
faces (the faces were not shown to the raters) were rated higher.
Possible explanation: people with more symmetrical faces are more
attractive, thus, treated better, thus, more confident, thus, more
comfortable dancing.</p>

<p>Women faces at ovulation become a bit more symmetrical.</p>

<h3 id="secondary-sexual-characteristics">Secondary sexual characteristics.</h3>

<p>There is a handicap principle from Zahavi. Individuals show through
secondary sexual characteristics that they have so much energy that
they can afford to spend it on such not immediately useful features.
Such features are also often markers of health and immune system (lots
of evidence).</p>

<p>In Marsupial mice - males with more dramatic secondary characteristics
have more fertile sperm.</p>

<p>Study - the better a western country is doing (life expectancy,
economy, quality of life), the less bias women have for secondary
sexual characteristics in males (big jaw,  high forehead, better
developed muscles).</p>

<p>One can also detect whether other individual is infectious via
secondary sexual characteristics. Many such characteristics advertise
having no communicable diseases. Many species are good at detecting
smells of parasitic infections.</p>

<p>There is also cheating - a selection to uncouple these characteristics
from one’s health. In birds, one observes sick animals spending too
many calories on developing their secondary sexual characteristics.</p>

<p>Problem with all such research - intensity of such characteristics
has to reflect quality of immune system. Facial coloration linearly
depends on immune system. However, in vultures - one gets carotenoids
for face coloration by eating ungulate feces. They also contain a lot
of parasites. This way they say “see, I can handle so many infections,
thus, my DNA must be really good”. This is a controversy.</p>

<p>Lions are highly tournamental species. Black mane in males is the most
attractive and the most expensive to develop. However, your head heats
up more, so you have to balance the attractiveness of your mane with
spending more energy on your thermo regulation.</p>

<p>Some such characteristics are direct markers of fertility. In primates
females have external swellings when ovulating. Humans are concealed
ovulators. Some baboon females have bigger swellings than other. Male
baboons prefer larger swellings. They are a marker of estrogen levels.
Females with larger swellings have better infant survival rate.
However, it is also a handicap, one can gain 25% more weight due to
water retention for the swelling.</p>

<p>In humans there is waist-hip ratio. The bigger this ratio is, the
better the fertility is. However, in more traditional societies you
don’t see this preference that much. Perhaps this is just a bias of
western culture.</p>

<p>In human males - larger jaws &amp; high foreheads, more developed muscle
mass - markers of testosterone levels.</p>

<p>Rounder faces of men are perceived as more likable, more honest, more
trustworthy, but less desirable.</p>

<p>When women ovulate, they prefer more expressed secondary sexual
characteristics.</p>

<p>However, there is another problem with this line of reasoning. Let’s
say a female gazelle mates with a male with amazing secondary sexual
characteristics and gets a kid. She will expand more calories to take
care of the kid, because it has great reproductive potential. In birds</p>
<ul>
  <li>larger eggs when mating with more attractive males. In other words,
a female makes this a self fulfilling prophecy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also females take into account how other females perceive males. Lee
Gugatkin did a study looking at female rejecting males. After a
rejection, fake female birds were placed around the male to make him
look really popular. The rejecting female was than more likely to do
solicitive courting. In other words she is jumping in a band wagon:
“If I don’t find him attractive, but others do, these traits must be
actually good and I want them in my kids”.</p>

<p>In pair bonding species males show that they can be a good parent.
Thus, there are markers of parenting skills. In non-pair bonding
primates, females with kids are more preferred, since this is a marker
of parental competence.</p>

<h3 id="homogamy">Homogamy</h3>

<p>Individuals like other individuals, who are more similar to them.
E.g. in the US for marriages there is 90% likelihood to share same
religion, 3 year age window, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status
during childhood, political views. 40% for IQ and education. 20-40% -
same percentile of height (taken per gender), weight, hair color, lung
capacity, width of nostrils, width of eyes (probably markers for race
and ethnicity).</p>

<p>This brings us again to kin selection. Mating with third to fourth
cousin is optimal and also improves fertility. I.e. you should share
great-great-grandparents (grand parents of your grandparents) or
great-great-great-grand parents.</p>

<p>In agricultures villages people in marriages originally lived less
than 10 kilometers away. In Iceland people are not more than 6th
cousin apart and they have clear records going back centuries.</p>

<p>Children have optimal survival rate in third-fourth cousin marriages.</p>

<p>In the US people make less homogenous choices when they are younger.
This illustrates that people get more close minded as they get older.
There is an exception for religion, there is a second peak of
likelihood to enter non-homogenous marriage around 50-60 years old.
Such people often have already been living for a long time together.
One possible explanation - they wait for their parents to die, in
order not to disappoint them with such a marriage.</p>

<h3 id="commonalities-across-cultures">Commonalities across cultures</h3>

<p>In every single cultures women are more likely than men to want older
males. Men - younger females. Women look at economic prowess, men -
fertility markers. This is researched by David Buss.</p>

<p>These are also cliches. Because in all cultures across sexes there is
the same top ranked preference to wind up with someone who is nice to
you.</p>

<h2 id="aggression">Aggression</h2>

<p>You learn when to be aggressive, e.g. brutally tackling an aggressive
football player is perceived much better than doing the same to Nelson
Mandela. We welcome violence when it is of the right kind.</p>

<p>Aspects which were considered unique to humans, but are not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Killing for pleasure. There is competitive infanticide. First
observed in langur monkeys by Sara Hardy. Initially people explained
this as a psychopathology and caused by humans invading their habitat.
Jane Goodall observed killings in chimpanzees. They even make weapons
and have organized violence. All adult males in the group are
relatives, so they have cooperative aggression and border patrols.
They get extremely excited and start patrolling their territory. When
encountering a male from a different group, they will kill him. There
are cases of male chimps systematically killing males of neighboring
groups, i.e. genocide (killing because of the group one belongs to).</li>
</ul>

<p>// While looking up this topic, I encountered “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe_Chimpanzee_War">Gombe Chimpanzee
War</a>” article
in Wikipedia with casualties and commanders. I was surprised. Looks
like this was observed by Goodall.</p>

<ul>
  <li>reconciliation - doing something affiliative after aggression. Frans
de Waal studies this. Observed in rhesus monkeys, dolphins, whales,
gorillas - social grooming after fight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Odds of reconciliation increase when the relationship is more
important (e.g. in macaque). E.g. pairs which had history of
cooperation (like bringing food together to a cage).</p>

<p>There can be gender differences - e.g. in baboons only females
reconcile. In bonobos they have sex instead of grooming. One also
requires aggression for reconciliation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>empathy - chimps, lab rats (studied by Frans de Waal). If a male is
attacked by a more dominant male - an innocent bystander (i.e. not
picking a fight) is far more likely to be groomed by females
afterwards than the one who picked up the fight with more dominant
male. Rats send ultrasonic alarm calls when restrained. Rats who hear
the alarm have lower pain threshold, but only when the rat producing
the alarm is e.g. their cage mate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sense of justice. Chimps - after a cooperation in which one chimp
gets the food, that chimp is more likely to share the food.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dominance hierarchies. Top down - single (despotic) most aggressive
individual with uneven resource distribution due to threats, e.g.
baboons, chimps, rhesus monkeys. Bottom up (egalitarian) - (e.g.
velvet monkeys) - number one cooperates with everyone, if they get
abusive - they get overthrown.</p>
  </li>
  <li>rough-and-tumble play. In famine times this is the last of behaviors</li>
  <li>to disappear in kids.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unique aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sado- &amp; masochism (due to confusing sex behavior with aggression).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unusual domains of empathy. E.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBqhIVyfsRg">an Ikea
ad</a>, showing a lamp being
thrown out causing empathy reaction to the lamp and then “What’s wrong
with you, it is just a lamp, a new one also works better”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being passive aggressive, killing indirectly (e.g. by releasing a
bomb or looking away). E.g.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a 5 year old child broke other kid easter egg and then was
  forced by paint a new one. They painted it completely black
  (complied with the requirement, but still were aggressive).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Professor’s wife. Once she was driving and they were cut off by
  someone. His wife started following that person and eventually
  reached them on a long red light. She came to the window and
  threw a lollipop inside with “Anyone who does something like
  that, needs this”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In Nevada, many men every day wake up, kiss their family and go
  to work to control drone airplanes in Iraq killing people
  thousands of miles away.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extreme empathy</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“I will let no man to spoil my soul by causing me to hate him.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sister Helen Prejean: “the less forgivable the act is, the more
  it must be forgiven”.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tricky-aspects-of-studying-aggression">Tricky aspects of studying aggression</h3>

<p>Take Paras monkeys - no male fights in nature. Put two in a cage -
they will fight to death. Their social structure is built around
keeping males as far as possible from each other (the tension is
high), thus, they live in very dispersed patterns. Are they non-
aggressive (no fights) or extremely aggressive?</p>

<p>Ripping other individual to shreds can be an aggression or getting
dinner.</p>

<h3 id="mechanisms-in-the-brain">Mechanisms in the brain</h3>

<p>One second before a violent act in the brain - limbic system plays
important role. E.g. amygdala. Individuals with destroyed amygdala are
incapable to elicit aggression. In humans there were court ordered
amygdalectomies in 60-70s. They would decrease aggression and a lot of
other stuff. Basically there wouldn’t be a whole lot of a person left
afterwards.</p>

<p>There is also stimulation evidence - produces wildly aggressive
behavior. There is rare epilepsy in amygdala. Normally epileptics
observe some signs of coming seizure - can be odor, seeing math
equations, auditory. When amygdala is affected - people become
extremely furious. Charles Whitman - mass murdered in 1962, was found
to have a tumor in his amydgala. In 1970s there was Baader Meinhof
gang in Germany, one of them had a tumor in her amygdala.</p>

<p>One’s amygdala activates when you evoke anger in someone. It also gets
bigger in PSTD victims, which leads to increased frequency of violent
behavior.</p>

<p>People with lesions in this area are very bad at detecting faces,
which express anger. They are more trusting than average and more
likely to forgive. There is a study by Antonio Damasio showing that
such people don’t look at eyes of other people. In other words
amygdala is able to direct you to look for aggression.</p>
